ACT ONE
RECAP -- NIGHT ONE
We Recap the events from Night One, ending on Adama facing the news that Lee is dead.
FADE IN:
INT. GALACTICA - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Adama stares at the Dradis screen, can't believe it. He looks around CIC for a beat, his gaze finally 
landing on Tigh, who meets his eyes, knows the truth.
ON THE DRADIS SCREEN
The large energy bloom still blots the screen. The two Cylon fighters turn and fly away from the 
bloom.
GAETA (O.S.)
Cylons moving off, sir.
RESUME
The CIC remains utterly silent, everyone knows what just happened to their commander's son. 
Adama sits down heavily in a chair. Lost for the moment. The silence hangs heavy in the air. Tigh 
finally steps up.
TIGH
Resume Jump prep.
Everyone goes back to work. Gaeta resumes going through his checklist. Tigh takes a beat, puts 
a hand on Adama's shoulder, then goes over to rejoin Gaeta at the FTL station. 
Adama stares off into middle distance. 
INT. TRANSPORT SHIP - COCKPIT
Lee sits back in his seat, very much alive, and looking relieved.
LEE
I think it worked.
Laura and the Pilot share in the feeling of cautious relief.
TRANSPORT PILOT
How can you be sure?
LEE
I'm not. But if the Cylons weren't fooled, they'd be on top 
of us by now.
LAURA
What did you do exactly?LEE
It was a theory we toyed with at the War College. Some 
scientist discovered that double-banking the soliton wave 
generated by a faster-than-light drive mimicked a thermonuclear radiation signature. 
Laura throws a look to the Pilot who translates it.
TRANSPORT PILOT
He used the hyperdrive to put out a big... pulse of energy 
that looks like a nuclear explosion.
LEE
We used to wargame the possibility that it could be used 
to trick enemy sensors into thinking a distant target had 
been destroyed in battle.
TRANSPORT PILOT
Does the rest of the fleet know about that trick?
LEE
I doubt it. We, uh... we were never successful in our war 
games.
LAURA
Come again?
LEE
It always failed in the simulations. The Cylons always 
saw right through the fake and destroyed the target 
anyway.
LAURA
(to Pilot)
The lesson here is not to ask follow-up questions, but 
simply say...
(to Lee)
"Thank you, Captain Apollo for saving our collective 
asses."
TRANSPORT PILOT
Thank you Captain Apollo for saving our collective asses.
LEE
You're... welcome. Now, if I could suggest that we...
LAURA
... evacuate the passenger liner and get the hell out of 
here before the Cylons realize their mistake? I'm right 
there with you, Captain.
EXT. SPACE - SHARON'S RAPTOR - CHASE CAMERA POV
The Raptor is cruising through space.SHARON (V.O.)
Three... Two... One... Launch.
A SMALL DRONE LAUNCHES from beneath the Raptor's wing and blazes out into space.
INT. SHARON'S RAPTOR - COCKPIT
Sharon watches the telemetry from the drone on her console.
SHARON
Drone deployed... and transmitting.
The little BOY from the Night One Teaser photo is sitting in the co-pilot's seat. He looks over at her 
with a worried expression.
BOY
Now they'll come find us?
SHARON
(gently)
I hope so.
BOY
How?
SHARON
Well, see there's a lot of interference around here -- a lot 
of noise. Keeps my wireless from working.
BOY
Noise from the Cylons?
SHARON
That's right. And hopefully, once that communications 
pod I just launched gets far enough away from here, a 
Colonial ship will pick up the signal and start looking for 
us.
The Boy nods his head seriously. There's a quiet beat.
BOY
Is everyone on Kobol dead?
SHARON
I don't know.
BOY
My Mom's dead. They told me. 
SHARON
I'm sorry.
BOYThat was when I was little. My Dad's an officer in the 
Colonial fleet. A Colonel. They told me he's missing. 
But I think he's dead too.
He says it as a statement of fact, and looks at her with that same seriousness of expression.
SHARON
You know something... both my parents died when I was 
little too.
BOY
Really?
SHARON
Hm-mm.
BOY
Who do you live with?
SHARON
A bunch of other people on a ship called the Galactica.
BOY
Is that a battlestar?
SHARON
That's right.
BOY
Can I live there too?
A beat as she looks at him and then makes a life decision.
SHARON
Yes. Yes, you can. You can live there with me.
The Boy nods, stoically accepts that as a fact.
SHARON (cont'd)
What's your name?
BOXEY
Boxey.
INT. SHARON'S RAPTOR - INNER BAY
The rest of the survivors are packed in the cramped seats of the Inner Bay which was designed for a 
couple of people at most. The other four kids are older than Boxey and they're sitting together. A 
couple of them are asleep. Baltar shifts in his seat, tries to get comfortable. Suddenly he hears a 
familiar VOICE --
NUMBER SIX (O.S.)
You know what I love about you, Gaius?He looks up in panic to see Number Six sitting right across from him.
NUMBER SIX (cont'd)
You're a survivor. Like me.
There's an o.c. THUMP -- Baltar looks away to see that one of the kids shifting in their sleep and 
thumped the bulkhead. He looks back -- and Number Six is gone.
That's twice now he's imagined seeing her. What the hell...?
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA - TOP HULL CAMERA
Showing the view over the bow as the ship makes a TURN.
DUALLA (WIRELESS)
Starbuck/Galactica. Three enemy contacts identified as 
fighters now bearing 220-015. Speed 7 decimal 4...
EXT. SPACE - KARA'S VIPER - OVERHEAD COCKPIT POV
There are (old) VIPERS visible to either side as Kara leads the group out to engage the fighters.
DUALLA (WIRELESS)
Range 705 and closing.
INT. KARA'S VIPER - CONSOLE POV
Looking up at Kara as she answers Galactica. A couple of Vipers are visible out the canopy.
KARA
Copy that Galactica.
ON DRADIS SCREEN
Where three BLIPS can be seen.
KARA (O.S.)
We have good targets. Starbuck out.
RESUME
KARA (cont'd)
(looks around)
All right, listen up. I think I figured something out here. 
That beam thing they tried to hit us with last time? I think 
that's what they've been using to knock out Colonial 
defenses. But for some reason, it's not working against 
these old Vipers. I don't know why and I don't care. All 
that matters is we've got a level playing field out here now.
(beat)
So stay with your wingman, keep your interval and 
remember your training. The Cylons weren't counting on 
having to do any dogfighting today, so I don't think they're quite ready for this. On my mark, kick in your burners. 
Three, two, one, mark.
EXT. SPACE - VIPER FORMATION - CHASE CAMERA POV
The Viper AFTERBURNERS kick in and they BLAZE away from us.
EXT. KARA'S VIPER - OVERHEAD COCKPIT POV
Up ahead, THREE balls of LIGHT begin to resolve themselves into CYLON FIGHTERS.
KARA (WIRELESS)
Here they come... ready... BREAK.
MULTI-SCREEN:
1 -- EXT. SPACE - VIPER FORMATION 
The formation BREAKS APART into PAIRS and OPEN FIRE.
2 -- EXT. SPACE - THE CYLONS
The Cylons are forced to break their own formation to dodge the FIRE from the Vipers.
3 -- INT. KARA'S VIPER - CONSOLE POV
As she pursues the Cylons.
4 -- EXT. KARA'S VIPER - WING CAMERA POV
The starfield behind Kara's canopy is filled with twisting, turning, firing Vipers.
5 -- INT. VIPER COCKPIT - CONSOLE POV
A Galactica Pilot struggles in the fight.
6 -- EXT. SPACE - CYLON FIGHTER - WING CAMERA POV
The Cylon ship firing, twisting, turning.
We start ROTATING MORE SCREENS IN, moving OTHERS OUT, constantly changing our 
perspective from interior to exterior, Cylon to Viper, and our impression of combat is more like the 
real thing -- fast paced, confusing, hard to tell friend from foe and happening all at once:
1 -- Two Vipers firing furiously.
2 -- A Cylon twists and turns.
4 -- Kara's head whipping around in her cockpit.
6 -- A Cylon fires.
1 -- A Viper is damaged.2 -- A Cylon makes an impossibly tight turn, fires.
1 -- A Viper skids sideways to avoid Cylon fire.
3 -- Kara straining against g-forces in a tight turn.
1 -- A Viper EXPLODES.
5 -- A Viper Pilot struggles to escape a Cylon.
4 -- Kara DESTROYS a Cylon.
1 -- Four Vipers swarm around a single Cylon fighter, in a blur of motion too quick to follow, then the 
Cylon EXPLODES.
3 -- INT. KARA'S VIPER - CONSOLE POV
She twists around, looks around the stars for the enemy.
KARA
That's two down, where's their buddy?
PILOT #1 (WIRELESS)
This is Tailgate! He's on my ass! Need help out here!
KARA
All right, here we come!
1 -- The Vipers form up on Kara, head off to help.
7 -- EXT. SPACE - VIPER & CYLON - CHASE CAMERA POV
The Cylon is matching the Viper move for move -- then suddenly it breaks off the chase.
PILOT #1 (WIRELESS)
Wait-wait-wait -- he's broken off. Frak! He's heading 
toward Galactica!
COLLAPSE SCREENS 
TO:
EXT. SPACE - THE CYLON FIGHTER - CHASE CAMERA POV
The Cylon is heading right for the still distant Galactica.
INT. KARA'S VIPER - CONSOLE POV
As she watches the Cylon head for the defenseless ship...
FADE OUT.
END OF ACT ONE
ACT TWOFADE IN:
EXT. SPACE - KARA'S VIPER - OVERHEAD COCKPIT POV
As the Viper swings around toward the Cylon missile and the defenseless Galactica.
KARA (WIRELESS)
Galactica/Starbuck -- one got through, repeat one got 
through! We're kicking in the burners but watch yourself!
INT. GALACTICA - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Tigh in command, Gaeta at Tactical, Dualla on her headset.
TIGH
Helm, stand-by emergency maneuvers!
DUALLA
Copy that, Starbuck.
GAETA
(to speakers)
All decks brace for--
ADAMA (O.S.)
Belay that.
Everyone turns in surprise -- Adama is still in his chair, hasn't moved or spoken since the moment 
he believed Lee died. He doesn't raise his voice, doesn't even get out of his chair, and yet he's 
retaken command of his ship in a crisis. The old lion isn't dead yet.
ADAMA (cont'd)
(to Dualla)
Order the fighters to stand-off. We'll handle this one.
MULTI-SCREEN:
1 -- INT. COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Dualla relaying the order.
DUALLA
Starbuck/Galactica. Stand-off, repeat, stand-off. We'll 
handle this one.
2 -- INT. KARA'S VIPER - CONSOLE POV
Showing her surprised reaction.
KARA
Okay...
(under)
Whatever that means.3 -- EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA - HULL CAMERA
From a camera on Galactica's hull, we see the Cylon heading straight toward us -- head-on.
4 -- EXT. SPACE - CYLON FIGHTER - HULL CAMERA
A reciprocal view from a camera mounted on the Cylon fighter, we see the Galactica rushing 
straight toward us.
1 -- Adama picks up a HANDSET. Everyone is tense, quiet. Gaeta watches the Dradis tactical 
screen.
ADAMA
(to handset)
Engine room/Combat. Stand-by e-chock valves on tank 
one.
GAETA
Range 310... 300... 290... 280...
2 -- Kara and her Vipers swing around and pull away from Galactica. [Drop this split now.]
3 & 4 -- The ships get closer together.
1 -- Gaeta keeps watching the screen, everyone tenses, wondering what Adama will do.
ADAMA
Standby, Helm...
GAETA
250... 240... 230...
ADAMA
Helm, top bow, bottom stern emergency full.
The Helmsmen WORK the controls and it all happens very fast:
5 -- EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA - CHASE CAMERA POV
The giant ship FLIPS END FOR END.
3 & 4 -- The maneuver from Galactica and the Cylon POV.
6 -- CYLON UNDERBELLY - WING CAMERA POV
The bomb bay doors OPEN as before, and FIVE nuclear-tipped MISSILES drop down.
1 -- Adama is watching the gauges.
ADAMA
(to phone)
Main fuel dump -- execute.4 & 5 -- We see A CLOUD OF FUEL pour out of Galactica's stern VENTS.
1 -- Adama turns back to the Helmsman.
ADAMA (cont'd)
Right stern thruster -- one burst.
One of the Helmsmen hits a button --
4, 5, 6 -- The nuclear missiles are just heading out of the bomb bay when a SINGLE BURST of 
ENERGY shoots out from the right stern thruster of Galactica and IGNITES the entire CLOUD of 
FUEL. There's no time for the Cylon fighter to react and it's IMMOLATED along with the missiles. 
[Drop 4 & 6 splits.]
7 -- EXT. SPACE - VIPER FORMATION - CHASE CAMERA POV
The Vipers can see the explosion from a safe distance away.
2 -- INT. KARA'S VIPER - CONSOLE POV
As she reacts to the explosion.
1 -- Only now, the crisis over, does Adama finally get out of his chair and stand on the deck of his 
ship once more.
ADAMA
(to Dualla)
Bring'em home. 
(to Gaeta)
Resume Jump prep.
DUALLA
Starbuck/Galactica. You're directed to land your 
squadron.
2 -- Kara is more than relieved.
KARA
(to mic)
Galactica/Starbuck. Copy that. We're coming home.
(to herself)
Old Man, you are really something else...
COLLAPSE SCREENS 
TO:
INT. GALACTICA - HANGAR BAY
A short time later, Kara's Viper rides the elevator DOWN into the Hangar Bay, where it STOPS. 
She pops the canopy, takes off her helmet and climbs down. We can see her flight suit is soaked 
in sweat as she walks around the Viper. Tyrol and Cally are standing at the rear of the ship.
TYROL
Starbuck, what did you do to my Viper?Kara looks up to see a HUGE CHUNK is MISSING from one of the three engines.
KARA
Wondered why the engine gave out.
TYROL
(to Cally)
We gotta pull the whole mounting. Get the high-lift.
Cally moves off.
TYROL (cont'd)
(to Kara)
How you managed to fly this thing, much less land it...
KARA
Not something I want to think about right now. Where's 
Prosna? He has to get that frakking gymbal locked or I'll 
have his ass. 
TYROL
Dead, sir. Died in the fire.
Beat.
KARA
How many did we lose?
TYROL
Eighty-five.
KARA
Right.
She heads off. Tyrol thinks for a beat, then stops her.
TYROL
Lieutenant?
(beat)
I don't know if you heard about Captain Adama, but...
KARA
Heard what?
He shakes his head. Doesn't need to say anything more. For a moment, Kara reacts like he 
reached out and slapped her. Then her emotional mask drops down into place.
KARA (cont'd)
Right.
She walks away. Pauses. Turns back again just as Cally returns with a large hydraulic LIFT.
KARA (cont'd)
Any word on Sharon?Tyrol is caught off-guard, tries to hide his emotional reaction, but isn't entirely successful.
TYROL
No, sir. 
Kara EXITS. Tyrol stands there for a beat. Cally sees the look on his face, overheard the last 
exchange.
CALLY
You okay, Chief?
TYROL
(no)
Get back to work.
He walks off.
INT. TRANSPORT SHIP - CARGO BAY
Sharon's Raptor is parked next to Lee's Viper in what is now getting to be a crowded space. The 
Survivors are coming off the Raptor and having their names taken down by Doral, while Lee listens 
to Sharon's report. Boxey is hanging out near her, looking around the bay with interest.
SHARON
... I've got two communication pods left sir, but that's it. 
No swallows, no jiggers, no drones, no markers... nothing.
LEE
Well, at least you've got a full electronic suite. That old 
crate of mine can barely navigate from A to B.
SHARON
That crate may have saved your life, sir.
LEE
How's that?
SHARON
The Mark seven Vipers? Cylons shut'em down like they 
threw a switch or something. And I've been hearing 
reports like that from all over. The only fighters out there 
having any success at all are either old or in need some 
kind of major overhaul.
Lee thinks about that, sees Baltar get out of the Raptor.
LEE
That him?
SHARON
Yes, sir. Hope he's worth it.
(beat)
Sorry, sir.LEE
Don't be. I hope he's worth it too.
(calls out)
Doctor Baltar? The President would like to see you.
BALTAR
President Adar is here?
LEE
No. I'm afraid Adar is dead. President Laura Roslin was 
sworn in a few hours ago.
BALTAR
Oh.
LEE
If you'll wait a moment, I'll take you to her.
Doral comes over to Boxey.
DORAL
Hi there. What's your name, little man?
Boxey just looks at him with that contempt children reserve for condescending adults.
DORAL (cont'd)
I bet you're hungry...
Silence. Sharon and Doral exchange a look -- and she holds his gaze just a moment too long.
SHARON
He's with me.
(to Boxey)
Boxey, go with him, get something to eat. I'll come find 
you, okay?
BOXEY
Promise?
SHARON
Promise.
Boxey goes with Doral and the rest of the survivors.
LEE
Kid's with you?
SHARON
He is now.
Lee leaves it at that.
LEE
Let's go.Lee, Sharon and Baltar head for the door.
INT. TRANSPORT SHIP - PASSENGER CABIN
With a couple of seats removed and a makeshift desk of sorts set up now, the cabin is starting to 
resemble something approaching an office. She shakes Baltar's hand as Lee and Sharon look on.
LAURA
A pleasure to meet you again, Doctor.
(off his blank look)
We met at last year's Caprica City Symposium.
BALTAR
Oh. Of course. Sorry. I uh... I'm bad with faces...
LAURA
Don't worry about it. I'm sure I wouldn't remember me 
either. I want you to serve as my chief scientific 
consultant and analyst. If anyone can give us insight into 
the Cylons and their technology, it's got to be you.
Baltar suddenly HEARS the soft sound of a WOMAN'S GIGGLE. It takes him a moment to realize 
that no one else hears it too.
BALTAR
I'd be honored... Madame President.
LAURA
Good.
(to Sharon)
What's your impression of the situation on Kobol?
SHARON
From what I could see, the Cylons appear to be 
systematically targeting every population center surface 
for nuclear attack. I doubt there's a city over a hundred 
thousand people left at this point.
LAURA
Doctor, am I correct in assuming that an attack of this 
magnitude will trigger a world-wide nuclear winter?
BALTAR
Yes. Fallout clouds are drifting across the major 
continents and altering weather patterns around the globe 
even as we speak.
Laura takes a step away from the rest of them, looks out the window for a long beat. Finally --
LAURA
(quiet)
Lieutenant Valerii, I understand your ship has a limited 
faster-than-light capability?SHARON
(surprised)
Uh, yes sir. The Raptor was designed to make short 
Jumps ahead of the fleet, scout for enemy ships, then 
Jump back and report.
Laura thinks for another beat, then turns back to face them.
LAURA
We need to find as many survivors as we can. As many 
ships as we can. And then we need to go.
LEE
Go where?
LAURA
I don't know. Somewhere. A new home. A place to start 
over. Whatever future the human race has... is not here 
anymore. It's out there somewhere. And it's up to us find 
it.
A quiet beat as they all look out the window and feel the heavy burden of responsibility they're just 
accepted.
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA
The ship hangs in space.
ADAMA
(prelap)
One more time around the horn, Colonel.
INT. GALACTICA - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Where the atmosphere is tense, expectant.
TIGH

(to Adama)
The board is green, ship reports ready to Jump, sir.
ADAMA
Very well. Take us to Ragnar, Colonel.
TIGH
Mister Gaeta, execute the Jump, please.
GAETA
Yes, sir.
Gaeata goes to the FTL console, makes a final visual check, then hits a button.
GAETA (cont'd)
The clock is running. In five, four, three, two, one, Jump.
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA
The ship JUMPS -- which we see not as the ship leaping forward or stretching out at superspeed, 
but rather as the Galactica suddenly FOLDING IN ON ITSELF like a enormous piece of origami and 
then disappearing.
EXT. SPACE - RAGNAR
The Galactica APPEARS via an UNFOLDING effect above the GAS GIANT planet of Ragnar. Amid 
the swirling bands of CLOUDS that define the atmosphere, there is one STORM FORMATION that 
should remind us of the "Red Eye" of Jupiter.
INT. GALACTICA - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
As before.ADAMA
Report.
GAETA
(works console)
Taking a bearing now... and we appear to be in 
geosynchronous orbit directly above the Ragnar 
anchorage.
Adama actually smiles for the first time today. CHEERS and APPLAUSE break out in the CIC and 
Tigh and Adama shake hands.
ADAMA
Old girl's got some life in her yet.
TIGH
Never doubted it for a moment.
ADAMA
All right, people...
(celebration subsides)
Mister Gaeta, secure the FTL drive and bring the sublight 
engines to full power. Colonel Tigh, please update your 
chart for the course down into the eye of the storm.
Everyone goes to work and we begin a MONTAGE sequence as the ship enters the storm, yet life 
goes on within the ship's hull...
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GALACTICA - KARA'S QUARTERS
Kara is putting on a new flight suit, tying the bootlaces. She pauses. Goes to a wall locker, 
OPENS it. Inside is a small FOLDED PHOTO of a smiling, happy Kara with her arm around a 
handsome young man in a cadet's uniform -- ZAK. She stares at the photo for a beat, then 
UNFOLDS the photo, revealing Lee standing next to Kara and smiling too. She looks at Lee's face, 
touches it. Then sinks down on her knees, head bowed:
KARA
Lords of Kobol, hear my prayer. Take the souls of Thine 
sons and daughters lost this day, especially that of... Lee 
Adama... into Thine hands...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA & RAGNAR STORM
Galactica is heading straight down into the very eye of the storm, making periodic adjustments from 
side to side and "up and down" as she navigates the course.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GALACTICA - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTERGaeta at the Helm, guiding the Helmsmen through their manuevers. Tigh at the Navigation station, 
calling out the adjustments from his chart. Adama watching over everything, letting his people do 
their jobs.
TIGH
Five seconds to turn three...
GAETA
Five seconds, aye.
TIGH
(beat)
And turn.
GAETA
Bow pitch positive one half, stern pitch negative one 
quarter, bow yaw negative three quarters...

Five seconds to turn four...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA & RAGNAR STORM
The ship TURNS again, is BUFFETED by the swirling WINDS.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GALACTICA - AIRLOCK/PASSAGEWAY
Tyrol and his Deck Hands are assembling in one of Galactica's airlocks with tool kits, and 
equipment. The ship LURCHES slightly.DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA & RAGNAR STATION
The ship is approaching the distant STATION down in the very heart of the storm.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GALACTICA - STARBOARD HANGAR DECK - MUSEUM
A temporary MORGUE has been set up in the heart of what was once the Museum. Bodies are 
being zipped up into bags under the grim eye of Captain Kelly.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA & RAGNAR STATION
END MONTAGE. Here in the heart of the storm, Galactica maneuvers alongside the enormous 
STATION which dwarfs the ship by comparison. Far in the b.g, the swirling winds of the STORM 
whirl around ship and station -- like being in the center of a hurricane, but on a much bigger scale. 
From our vantage (chase camera) Galactica is pointing straight "down" toward the (unseen) planet 
surface as she comes alongside the station.
The station itself consists of FOUR ROTATING "RINGS", each of which is connected to the same 
central "AXEL HUB" by a series of "SPOKES." (Imagine four spinning bicycle tires mounted on a 
single metal rod.) Galactica is maneuvering alongside the first "wheel" and matching her speed to 
the wheel's rotation. In terms of scale, if the Ring is a bicycle tire, then Galactica is the size of a 
baseball card.
GALACTICA - RING CAMERA POV
From a camera mounted on the top of the Ring, we watch Galactica edge closer and closer to the 
docking point.
TERMINAL AIRLOCK - GALACTICA CAMERA POV
The reverse angle as seen from a camera atop Galactia, looking at the approaching Ring airlock. 
The two come closer... closer... then DOCK.
INT. COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Gaeta is watching a DIAL on the Helm console. The dial is suddenly COVERED by a (mechanical) 
GREEN TAB.
GAETA
Hard seal.
(checks other dials)
Atmosphere and pressure check. Positive.
(to Adama)
Cleared for boarding party, sir.
ADAMA
Very well.Adama picks up a handset.
INT. GALACTICA - AIRLOCK/PASSAGEWAY
A HANDSET BUZZES on the bulkhead. Tyrol picks it up.
TYROL
Airlock Three, Chief Tyrol speaking.
ADAMA (PHONE)
We have a hard seal up here, Chief.
Tyrol glances at a wall display -- also showing a GREEN TAB.
TYROL
Confirm that, sir. I show hard seal as well.
ADAMA (PHONE)
Go find me some weapons coils, Chief.
TYROL
Will do, sir.
Tyrol hangs up, glances at his people -- Socinus and Cally among them.
TYROL (cont'd)
Get your gear and move out.
Tyrol works the airlock controls and the huge Galactica doors SLIDE AWAY. He leads his gang 
into the airlock, works another control, and the Station doors SLIDE AWAY. Tyrol steps forward, 
then stops in surprise at what he sees.
A MAN is standing in the station passageway. And he's pointing a GUN right at them.
FADE OUT.
END OF ACT TWO
ACT THREE
FADE IN:
INT. RAGNAR STATION/AIRLOCK
Continuous from Act Two. The Man -- LEOBEN CONOY -- is still pointing the gun right at them. 
He's about six feet tall, ruggedly handsome, early 30's, a classic looking hero if ever there was one, 
but at the moment, he doesn't look like he's in the best of shape. His breathing is a little ragged, 
his eyes red-rimmed and glassy. There's a dangerous, on the verge of hysterial, quality to his 
voice.
LEOBEN
I don't want any trouble...
TYROLSame here.
LEOBEN
But I'm not going to jail.
TYROL
(confused)
Okay...
LEOBEN
You understand? I'm not going to jail.
His hand tightens on the hand weapon and Tyrol tries to defuse the situation.
TYROL
Okay, okay. Easy now. No one's taking anyone to jail.
LEOBEN
Frakking right you're not.
TYROL
I'm not a policeman. We're not here to arrest you.
Leoben blinks, looks over his uniform, begins to doubt his initial instinct.
LEOBEN
Yeah, maybe... so who are you?
TYROL
We're from the battlestar Galactica. Colonial Fleet.
LEOBEN
What -- and you just happened to drop in? Don't give me 
that. This place's been abandoned for years. It's a junk 
yard. That's why I'm here. But what would a battlestar be 
doing here?
TYROL
We need some equipment from the station to get back in 
the fight.
LEOBEN
What the frak are you talking about? What fight?
TYROL
You don't know?
LEOBEN
Know what? You think I'm stupid or something? I'm not 
falling for this! I want passage outta here! I want a safe 
transport ship with an untraceable Jump system! 
Leoben is clearly desperate and physically worked up. Tyrol glances at his people, then backs up 
into the airlock. He picks up a handset from the Galactica side of the airlock.TYROL
Combat, Airlock Three. Sir, we've got a situation down 
here...
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. RAGNAR STATION/AIRLOCK
Adama himself is here, and is using his best diplomatic calm to get through to this guy.
ADAMA
... we don't know much more than that. But it's imperative 
that we get the equipment we need and get our ship back 
in service as quickly as possible.
Leoben is stunned, suddenly very unsure of himself -- but he still has the gun.
LEOBEN
But... but why would the Cylons, after all these years... I 
mean, just like that, with no warning... doesn't make 
sense... does it?
ADAMA
It doesn't have to make sense. It's the truth.
LEOBEN
(shocked)
A nuclear attack... on the colonies...? How many people 
are...?
ADAMA
We don't know.
Leoben still has his weapon pointed at them. Adama's patience finally runs out.
ADAMA (cont'd)
Look, Mister...?
LEOBEN
Conoy. Leoben Conoy.
ADAMA
Mister Conoy, I have close to two thousand people on that 
ship and unless you think you can shoot every single one 
of us, I suggest you get out of the way and let us get
those coils right now.
The tone of command in Adama's voice does the trick. Leoben lowers his weapon and Adama 
calmly takes it away from him.
ADAMA (cont'd)
Thank you.
(to Tyrol)
Chief?TYROL
Yes, sir! All right, people let's get an inventory and find 
those coils!
Tyrol and his deck hands start to move down the passageway.
LEOBEN
You looking for weapons coils?
ADAMA
That's right.
LEOBEN
There may be a problem with that...
ADAMA
(yells)
Hold on, Chief!
(to Leoben)
What was that?
LEOBEN
(sheepish)
Well... coils like that would fetch quite a price on the open 
market... that's why I'm here, you know? To scavenge 
equipment, sell it, make a nice profit. Nothing wrong with 
that.
ADAMA
You took the coils?
LEOBEN
It's just a bunch of junk no one was using -- I didn't know 
you'd need them!
ADAMA
Where are they?
LEOBEN
It's not my fault!
ADAMA
Where?
LEOBEN
They're in one of loading bays, I was getting ready to bring 
them aboard my ship.
Adama tries to keep his exasperation from getting the better of him.
ADAMA
Show me.
Leoben leads the Galactica crew down the passageway.INT. TRANSPORT SHIP - CARGO BAY
Where Sharon's Raptor still sits.
INT. SHARON'S RAPTOR - COCKPIT
Sharon is going over a preflight checklist. Boxey is sitting in the co-pilot seat next to her.
BOXEY
Do you have kids?
SHARON
No.
BOXEY
Do you want kids?
SHARON
I've thought about it, but... I can't have children.
BOXEY
Why not?
SHARON
Honestly? I... don't know, actually. I mean, I've never 
been told by a doctor or anything, but... somehow I've 
always just known... in my heart... that I can't have 
children.
BOXEY
Does that make you sad?
SHARON
Sometimes.
A quiet beat as Sharon keeps going over her checklist and flipping switches in the cockpit.
BOXEY
Can I go with you on your mission?
SHARON
No.
BOXEY
Are you going to come back?
She gives him a very direct look.
SHARON
Yes I am, Boxey.
She holds his gaze for a long beat. He accepts the finality of that statement. Nods his head. She 
goes back to work.INT. TRANSPORT SHIP - PASSENGER CABIN
Baltar is sitting in a seat with a fold-down desk in front of him, as he tries to sort through a stack of 
print-outs and messages. He senses someone watching him, looks up -- there's Number Six sitting 
in the chair across from him.
NUMBER SIX
I see they've put you to work.
Baltar doesn't answer, goes back to work.
NUMBER SIX (cont'd)
Ignoring me won't help.
BALTAR
(without looking up)
You're not here.
NUMBER SIX
No?
BALTAR
I've decided you're an expression of my subconscious 
mind playing itself out during my waking state.
NUMBER SIX
So I'm only in your head.
BALTAR
Exactly.
NUMBER SIX
Hm. Have you considered the possibility that I could very 
well exist only in your head... without being a 
hallucination?
He finally looks up at her.
NUMBER SIX (cont'd)
Maybe you see and hear me because while you were 
sleeping, I implanted a Cylon silica chip in your brain that 
transmits my image right into your conscious mind.
The possibility scares him more than he wants to admit, but then he fights back.
BALTAR
That... is just a statement of my subconscious fear which 
I also choose to ignore.
He tries to go back to work.
NUMBER SIX
What are you working on?BALTAR
If you were really a chip in my brain, I wouldn't have to tell 
you.
NUMBER SIX
Indulge me.
BALTAR
I'm trying to figure out how you managed to pull off this 
kind of attack. You seem to have shut down virtually the 
entire defense network without firing a shot. Entire 
squadrons lost power just as they engaged the enemy.
NUMBER SIX
All true.
BALTAR
Would you care to enlighten me as to how?
NUMBER SIX
You already know the answer to that, Gaius.
Baltar looks at her for a beat, then his blood freezes in his veins. He's up on his feet and moving 
away.
BALTAR
No! No, that's not it.
Number Six follows him languorously, slips her arms around him from behind as he stands near the 
window.
NUMBER SIX
I knew this would be hard for you. I'm sorry.
BALTAR
(shaky)
My CNP program... is not -- could not be responsible for 
this... it's just a navigation program...
NUMBER SIX
Of course it is...
BALTAR
There's no way it could be used to...
Suddenly he sees it. Realizes exactly how they did it. And it's devastating.
BALTAR (cont'd)
You made changes in the program... you said you were 
building in back doors for your company to exploit later...
NUMBER SIX
All true. In a sense. BALTAR
That was your job.
NUMBER SIX
Officially. Unofficially, I had other motives...
BALTAR
You can't mean... me?
NUMBER SIX
Us. We had something, Gaius. Something... special. 
BALTAR
This is insane. You're a machine, you can't have feelings. 
NUMBER SIX
I'm a person. A woman. I have hopes, feelings, wants, 
desires...
BALTAR
No...
NUMBER SIX
And I want you to love me.
He turns around, looks into a pair of eyes that seem completely human, completely vulnerable and 
hurt.
BALTAR
Love? You?
NUMBER SIX
Of course, Gaius. 
(smiles)
Don't you understand? God is love. 
She pulls his head to her, gently touches his lips.
BALTAR
NO!!
He pulls back and suddenly she's GONE. As if the encounter never happened. He stands there, 
stunned by the enormity of what he's done.
ADAMA
(prelap)
Been busy, haven't you?
INT. RAGNAR STATION - CARGO BAY
Adama is glaring at a massive collection of EQUIPMENT which has been BUNDLED onto several 
large PALLETS, each about the size of a small house. Every imaginable type of equipment is on 
the pallets, from small computers to giant conduits stretching 20 feet. Leoben is next to Adama, with a sheepish look on his face, while Tyrol and his crew are examining the pallets and trying to 
catalog what's here and where.
ADAMA
How long's it going to take you to sort this all out, Chief?
TYROL
Couple hours at least, sir. We gotta bring in our own 
lifters and cranes -- he's completely fouled up the station 
loaders.
Tyrol points up toward a pallet still held in mid-air by a giant CRANE attached to the ceiling.
LEOBEN
They were fouled up when I got here. All this stuff's been 
abandoned for years. It's a miracle I got it to work at all.
ADAMA
Do what you have to, Chief.
Tyrol goes back to examining the pallets. Adama heads over to the enormous AIRLOCK DOOR, 
and Leoben follows him.
LEOBEN
You know, I almost joined the military.
ADAMA
Really.
LEOBEN
Yeah. Failed the entrance exam though. Didn't get much 
sleep the night before and my girlfriend had just dumped 
me so --
ADAMA
(off wall monitor)
That your freighter docked out there?
LEOBEN
Yeah.
ADAMA
Well, you're gonna have to move it because we're gonna 
have to dock Galactica here in order to--
Suddenly there's the SOUND of GROANING METAL. Everyone looks up just in time to see the 
overhead CRANE suddenly BUCKLE under the weight of the suspended pallet. Adama grabs 
Leoben and pulls him out of the way just as the pallet, crane, and a good portion of the overhead 
structure comes CRASHING DOWN and everyone RUNS for their lives...
FADE OUT.
END OF ACT THREEACT FOUR
FADE IN:
INT. RAGNAR STATION - CARGO BAY
Tyrol and his crew are desperately searching through the WRECKAGE now covering the area where 
Adama was only a moment ago. It's chaotic.
CALLY
Commander! Commander Adama!
TYROL
Careful there! Don't move the wreckage until we know 
where he is!
CALLY
Commander!
TYROL
(to Deck Hand)
Get back to the ship. We're going to need hand lifters 
and--
CALLY
Wait! Listen!
They stop. Faintly, a RINGING can be heard. They look around, finally see a WALL PHONE. 
Tyrol rushes over, picks it up.
TYROL
Tyrol here.
(beat, relieved)
Commander! Are you all right? Where are you?
INTERCUT:
INT. RAGNAR STATION - PASSAGEWAY
Adama and Leoben are in a dark passageway just off the Cargo Bay. The way back in is blocked 
by WRECKAGE. Leoben is sitting on the floor, holding his head and looking a little woozy. Adama 
is using a wall phone.
ADAMA
We're fine, we're fine. We're in a passageway near the 
airlock. Anyone hurt?
TYROL
No, sir.
ADAMA
Any of the coils damaged?
TYROLI don't think so, sir. Looks to me like that pallet was 
holding mostly computer gear.
ADAMA
Good. We've got wreckage blocking our way back in...
TYROL
I'll get some men and we'll get you out of --
ADAMA
No. Get the coils. That's your priority, Chief. Don't spare 
a single man for anything else.
(to Leoben)
You know a way around?
LEOBEN
Uh... yeah. But we'll have to take the ring around to the 
next spoke, go down to the central axis, then go back up 
the spoke to the cargo bay.
ADAMA
(to phone)
Okay, Chief. We'll find our way around.
TYROL
Sir, you sure that's a wise--
ADAMA
You have your orders. Tell Colonel Tigh he's in command 
until I return.
TYROL
Yes, sir.
They hang up.
END INTERCUT.
Leoben stands, leans against a bulkhead, looks weak.
ADAMA
You don't look so good.
LEOBEN
I'm fine... something about this place...
ADAMA
This place?
LEOBEN
Ever since I got here... dizziness... trouble 
concentrating... think I'm allergic to something in the air...And it is at that moment, for reasons we don't yet fully understand, that Adama suddenly becomes 
deeply suspicious of Leoben. Adama keeps his cards close to the vest, tries not to let on that 
anything has changed, but from this moment on, he's extremely wary of Leoben. He's trapped in a 
situation with a man he no longer trusts, and they have a long way to go before they'll reach safety.
ADAMA
Shall we...?
Leoben nods and then leads the way down the passageway. We linger just long enough on 
Adama's face to see his expression harden. Then he follows Leoben.
EXT. SPACE - REFINERY SHIP
The Refinery Ship looks like a collection of enormous BALLOONS filled with LIQUID FUEL, all of 
which are connected to a small central habitation hub.
VOICE (WIRELESS)
This is the Refinery Vessel Tauranian to any Colonial 
ship. Anyone out there? Come on, somebody answer 
me...
Suddenly Sharon's Raptor JUMPS into the area in the same UNFOLDING EFFECT seen during 
Galactica's earlier Jump.
SHARON (WIRELESS)
Taurnanian this is Colonial Raptor 238.
INT. SHARON'S RAPTOR - COCKPIT
Where Sharon is working her controls.
SHARON
(to mic)
I have you in sight.
VOICE (WIRELESS)
Hello, Raptor! Can't tell you what a relief it is to see you!
SHARON
Same here. Tell me you got a full load of Tylium fuel in 
those big beautiful tanks.
INT. REFINERY SHIP - CONTROL HUB
The Control hub is shaped like a long, cylinder, studded with LARGE WINDOWS. The giant 
billowing FUEL BALLOONS are constantly monitored and maintained from here -- all via handoperated valves, pumps, etc. The Refinery CAPTAIN is on a hand-mic.
REFINERY CAPTAIN 
Almost full. We had a bag rupture yesterday and lost a 
few million gallons. What the frak is going on? 
Everything's jammed. We've only been getting scraps of 
wireless traffic. Is it true the Cylons have hit Kobol?SHARON (WIRELESS)
Afraid so.
REFINERY CAPTAIN
Bad?
SHARON (WIRELESS)
Worse than you want to know, Tauranian.
(beat)
Listen, is your FTL drive functional?
REFINERY CAPTAIN 
(somber)
That's affirmative.
INT. SHARON'S RAPTOR - COCKPIT
Sharon works her controls.
SHARON
Then I'm sending you a set of coordinates to program in. I 
want you to follow me to a rendezvous.
REFINERY CAPTAIN (WIRELESS)
Okay.
(beat)
Who else is at the rendezvous?
Beat.
SHARON
Everyone who's left.
EXT. SPACE - CIVILIAN SHIPS
A SMALL FLEET is gathering. Colonial vessels of every shape and size, from freighters to luxury 
liners are here. Even a few (new) VIPERS are in evidence, cruising through the area, guarding the 
fugitive fleet. 
The familiar Transport ship is DOCKING with a PASSENGER LINER.
INT. PASSENGER LINER - "SPACE PARK"
The Liner is the space-going equivalent to a contemporary cruise ship, built for pleasure and 
recreation. The "Space Park" is a large, sprawling artificial park complete with grass, trees, softly 
rolling hills etc., beneath a large TRANSPARENT DOME which allows for a glorious view of the 
heavens. At the moment, the park is crowded with PASSENGERS, who have gathered here to be 
together and provide comfort in numbers. Laura and the LINER CAPTAIN make their way through 
the crowd. Billy is right behind Laura as she goes from person to person trying to comfort people 
and listen to their concerns. 
LINER CAPTAIN
Most of the passengers are from Geminon or Picon, but 
we've got people from all over Kobol.LAURA
Give Billy a copy of your passenger manifest and a list of 
your emergency supplies.
LINER CAPTAIN
What about our power situation? Our batteries are 
starting to run pretty low.
LAURA
Captain Apollo will be making an engineering survey of all 
ships this afternoon.
BILLY
Actually, the Captain said it'll be more like this evening 
before he can coordinate the survey.
LAURA
All right, then, this evening. But we'll get your needs 
tended to, Captain. You have my word on it.
Laura moves through the crowd, looking at the numbing shock on the faces. Most people are shellshocked, quiet, families holding each other tightly. The fear in the air is palpable. She addresses 
the entire group --
LAURA (cont'd)
Don't give up hope. We're all going to get through this. 
But we have to believe in each other and trust in each 
other. If we do that, everything's going to be all right.
The looks she gets in return are far from reassured. They just stare at her and Laura hears how 
hollow her words sound. She tries to muster more resolve.
LAURA (cont'd)
If you've looked out the dome, you've probably seen the 
Vipers which have joined us. They'll help protect us 
against further attack. We're going to survive. We're 
going to make it out of this alive. We're not going to give 
up and we're going to make it.
It doesn't get much more of a reaction, but at least she says it with more conviction and more belief. 
She walks across the park and pauses where a little girl -- CAMI (7) -- is sitting alone beneath a 
tree, staring up at her. Laura bends down.
LAURA (cont'd)
What's your name?
A long pause.
CAMI
Cami.
LAURA
Hi, Cami. I'm Laura.
(beat)Are you all alone?
She nods and Laura looks at question to the Captain.
LINER CAPTAIN
(sotto)
She's here with her grandparents, but the grandmother's 
having health problems since the announcement -- don't 
worry we're taking care of her.
CAMI
My parents are going to meet me at the spaceport. In 
Caprica City.
Laura doesn't know what to say to that.
LAURA
I see...
CAMI
We're going to dinner. And I'm having chicken pie. And 
then we're going home. And then daddy's going to read to 
me. And then I'm going to bed.
Laura reaches out, smooths Cami's hair, then stands up and heads for the exit.
INT. TRANSPORT SHIP - PASSENGER CABIN
Laura sitting in a chair, staring out into middle distance, still thinking about that little girl. The 
fatigue, the stress, the enormous responsibility -- it's all weighing on her like never before. It takes 
a moment before she becomes aware of someone, looks up to see Lee and waves him to a seat.
LAURA
Captain?
LEE
(hands her paper)
Message from Lieutenant Valerii. She's found a fuel 
refinery ship.
(off her look)
Filled to the brim with Tylium.
LAURA
About time we caught a break. So that'll bring us to what 
-- 60 ships so far? Not bad for a few hours work...
LEE
No, sir... but only about 40 of those ships have fasterthan-light capabilities. We should start transferring people 
off the sublights and onto the FTL's as soon as possible.
LAURA
Makes sense.LEE
We should also bring the Vipers aboard the Transport.
LAURA
They're our only protection.
LEE
They're mark sevens -- new Vipers -- and from all 
indications, the Cylons have a way of just... shutting them 
down. We should bring them aboard and conserve them 
until we know how to protect them. 
LAURA
All right.
LEE
And... 
Laura looks at him -- there's more?
LEE (cont'd)
I don't think we should stay here much longer, sir. Sharon 
tells me the Cylons are starting to send sensor drones 
throughout the solar system, looking for survivor ships.
LAURA
They're... "mopping up."
LEE
Looks that way, sir.
LAURA
Am I right in assuming that there wouldn't be... mopping 
up unless they'd finished military operations on Kobol?
LEE
That'd be my assumption as well, sir.
Laura goes very quiet for a moment.
LAURA
You know the Education Ministry conducts the census.
LEE
No, I didn't know that.
LAURA
12 billion, 254 million, 197 thousand, 512. At last count.
A long beat as they contemplate that number and the lives it represents. Then Laura refocuses.
LAURA (cont'd)
Will they be able to track us through a Jump?LEE
No, sir. It's impossible.
LAURA
Theoretically impossible.
LEE
(conceding the point)
Theoretically.
She stares off again and Lee decides that their conversation must be over. He gets up and EXITS. 
Billy, waiting just outside the door, smoothly ENTERS once he's gone. Laura sits down heavily in a 
chair, puts her head in her hands. Billy intuitively takes a seat a short distance away and waits for 
the President. Finally, Laura looks up at his youthful face and broaches the subject she's tried to 
avoid for too long.
LAURA
I have cancer.
BILLY
I know.
(off her look)
Earlier, you know when you were in the bathroom... you 
got a message from a Doctor Westin asking when you 
wanted to set an appointment. He's one of the leading 
oncologists in the world. So I figured...
Laura looks at him, her eyes getting red-rimmed from the physical and emotional beating of the last 
two days.
LAURA
It's malignant.
BILLY
I'm sorry. Did they tell you...?
LAURA
My prognosis was... doubtful.
BILLY
I wish there was something I could say...
LAURA
Me too. Wish I could say it's the least of my worries right 
now... or that the magnitude of everything else has 
pushed it aside, but I can't. The entire world is coming to 
an end and all I can think about is that I have cancer and 
now I'm probably going to die. How selfish and pathetic is 
that? 
BILLY
I don't think it's selfish. I think it's human.
LAURAIt's not exactly what you want your President worried 
about right now.
She rubs a hand over her features again and Billy struggles to come up with something to say...
BILLY
Madame President... you're not alone in--
LAURA
No. No. It's okay. I'm not falling apart. Just cracking 
every once in a while.
BILLY
Can I get you anything?
LAURA
Coffee. As sweet as you can make it.
Billy heads for the door.
LAURA (cont'd)
And Billy? Not a word.
Billy nods and EXITS.
INT. TRANSPORT SHIP - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS
Billy heads down the Passageway. He stops the Transport Pilot.
BILLY
Not right now. She's in the middle of something.
TRANSPORT PILOT
Okay.
BILLY
Oh. And we're going to need a list of the doctors we've 
rescued so far and their specialties.
TRANSPORT PILOT
Sure.
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA & RAGNAR STATION
Galactica is REDOCKING herself at the second airlock, while Leoben's ship is floating idly nearby.
INT. RAGNAR STATION - PASSAGEWAY
Adama and Leoben have come to a locked HATCH in the dimly lit passageway. They both strain to 
move the locking mechanism.
ADAMA
No go. Thought you knew your way around here.Leoben sags against the wall. He's getting steadily worse and worse, his skin growing pale and 
sallow, sweat streaking his clothes, his eyes getting red-rimmed.
LEOBEN
I thought I did too.
ADAMA
This is the second dead-end you've taken us down.
LEOBEN
Sorry.
ADAMA
Well, let's keep going.
Adama waits, makes Leoben start first, then falls into step just a pace or two behind him.
LEOBEN
Can't help noticing you always keep me in front of you...
ADAMA
Habit.
LEOBEN
Military training, right? Never turn your back on a 
stranger, that kind of thing?
ADAMA
Something like that.
LEOBEN
Suspicion and distrust. That's how you live your life, 
right? Never trusting your fellow man. Sounds like a sad 
state of affairs to me.
ADAMA
I've learned to live with it.
LEOBEN
Amazing what a man will learn to live with isn't it? 
Suspicion, distrust, war, hatred, jealousy, revenge, 
cruelty, sadism -- a man can get used to anything.
ADAMA
You're a scavenger/philosopher I take it.
They stop at an intersection. Leoben's tone is deteriorating along with his condition, becoming less 
conversational, more accusatory.
LEOBEN
Just an observer of human nature. A man in my line of 
work tends to see things that don't get mentioned in polite 
society. You see people at their worst, their most 
desperate. Humanity isn't a pretty race when you get right down to it. We're never more than one step away 
from beating each other with clubs like savages fighting 
over a scrap of meat.
(beat)
You know, we probably deserve what's happened to us. 
The Cylons might be God's retribution for our many sins.
Adama considers him for a beat.
ADAMA
Maybe they are. Or maybe they're just a penance we 
have to endure.
(re: intersection.)
We go right here.
Leoben doesn't move, just watches him.
LEOBEN
I think I'd like you to go first this time.
A long, challenging look from Adama tells Leoben that the game is definitely afoot here. Each man 
knows the other man is watching the other carefully. And each man is starting to suspect that only
one of them is walking out of here alive.
Adama holds his eyes a moment longer, then abruptly turns and walks down the passageway, 
offering his back to Leoben for the first time. Leoben watches, then follows.
EXT. SPACE - SHARON'S RAPTOR & REFINERY SHIP

Suddenly an ALARM goes off on Sharon's console. She works the Dradis display -- there's a BLIP 
moving toward them.

The Drone does a quick fly-by of the survivor fleet then FOLDS on itself as it JUMPS away.
INT. TRANSPORT SHIP - PASSENGER CABIN
An urgent meeting moments later with the Transport Pilot, Laura, Doral, Lee and Baltar. Billy 
watches, but doesn't participate in the discussion.
TRANSPORT PILOT
It definitely scanned us before it Jumped.
LEE
We need to go -- now. The Cylons will be here any 
minute.
DORAL
Madame President, there are still thousands of people on 
the sublight ships. We can't just leave them.
TRANSPORT PILOT
I agree. We should use every second to get as many 
people off the sublights as we can. We can wait to Jump 
until we pick up a Cylon strike force moving in.
LEE
We're easy targets. They're going to Jump into the middle 
of our ships with a handful of nukes and wipe us out 
before we have a chance to react.
DORAL
We can't just leave them all behind! You'll be sacrificing 
thousands of people--
LEE
(hard)
But we'll be saving tens of thousands. I'm sorry to make it 
a numbers game, but we're talking about the survival of 
our race here. We don't have the luxury of taking risks 
and hoping for the best, because if we lose... we lose 
everything.
(to Laura)
And Madame President, this is the kind of decision that 
needs to be made right now.
She meets his eyes, knows he's right -- it's her call.
LAURA
(to Pilot)Order the fleet to Jump to Ragnar. Immediately.
The Transport Pilot hesitates for a beat, then EXITS to the Cockpit with Lee. Doral and Baltar head 
for the passageway, Doral shooting Laura a glare along the way. Only Billy is left behind. Laura 
notes him after a beat.
LAURA (cont'd)
Anything you want to say, Billy?
BILLY
No, sir.
(beat)
Yes, sir. That... little girl you saw today? Cami? Her 
ship can't make the Jump.
Laura doesn't say anything, just picks up her paperwork and goes back to work. Billy quietly EXITS 
and we stay with Laura, who may have papers in her hand, but certainly doesn't see them...

END OF ACT FOUR
ACT FIVEFADE IN:
INT. RAGNAR STATION - CARGO BAY/AIRLOCK/GALACTICA
Tigh has come down to get a first-hand report on the progress being made by Tyrol and his crew. 
The wreckage in the bay has been moved aside for the most part, and the precious weapon COILS 
are carefully being loaded onto LIFTERS, and then trundled into Galactica herself, which is now 
DOCKED just outside the large airlock doors. 
TYROL
... I'd say we're looking at three hours minimum before we 
have all four coils in place and ready to charge.
TIGH
All right. Keep me informed...
He starts to turn away, but Tyrol stops him.
TYROL
Sir...?
Tyrol hesitates, but Tigh's a bit on edge with everything that's happening. His impatience gets the 
better of him.
TIGH
What is it, Chief? Let's go.
TYROL
(quiet)
Well, sir... I talked to Cally and Socinus. They had the 
fire contained. It wasn't going to reach the hangar deck or 
the fuel lines. You didn't have to vent the compartment. 
(beat)
Just thought you should know, sir.
Tyrol holds his eyes for a beat, then heads across the bay. Tigh stands there in shock. Suddenly 
there's the ACTION STATIONS KLAXON from Galactica. Tigh bolts for a DECKHAND, who's 
holding a PHONE HANDSET with a long CORD which has been strung in through the airlock.
TIGH
(grabs handset)
Combat, this is Tigh!
GAETA (PHONE)
We have multiple contacts coming down through the 
storm, approaching the anchorage.
Tigh whirls the Deckhand around and starts propelling him back through the airlock into the 
Galactica passageway, Tyrol and his crew hot on his heels as everyone races to their action 
stations.
TIGH
(urgent, still on the phone)Cut us loose from the station. Launch the alert fighters. 
Set condition one throughout the ship, prepare for--
GAETA (PHONE)
Wait-wait! Getting Colonial signals now!
Tigh slows his run to a walk.
TIGH
Confirm that! Don't just accept a friendly ID.
A long, agonizing pause.
GAETA (PHONE)
Confirmed, sir! Incoming ships are friendly.
Tigh stops, vastly relieved.
TIGH
Secure from action stations.
GAETA (PHONE)
The lead ship is requesting permission to come alongside. 
They say... they say they have the President of the 
Colonies board.
Which is the last thing Tigh wants to deal with right now. But no way to avoid it.
TIGH
Grant the request. Tell... tell that woman that I'll see her 
in the Wardroom.
INT. GALACTICA - WARDROOM
Moments later, Tigh is looking at Laura Roslin with astonishment while Lee Adama looks on.
TIGH
You can't be serious.
LAURA
I'm not big on jokes today, Colonel.
TIGH
We're in the middle of rearming and repairing this ship. 
We can't afford to pull a single man off the line to start 
caring for refugees.
LAURA
I've got thousands of people out there. Some of them are 
hurt. Your priority has to be--
TIGH
My priority is preparing this ship for combat. In case you 
haven't heard, there's a war on.Laura looks in him with astonishment, like he's from another world. And in a way he is.
LAURA
Colonel, the war's over. And we lost.
TIGH
We'll see about that.
LAURA
Okay. Well. Then, as President of the Colonies I'm giving 
you a direct order to provide men and equipment to--
TIGH
You don't give orders on this ship.
Tigh heads for the door, but Lee stops him.
LEE
Hold on, Colonel.
(beat)
At least give us a couple of disaster pods.
TIGH
"Us?"
Lee ignores the implied reproach, pushes on.
LEE
Sir, we have fifty thousand people out there. Fifty 
thousand. We have sick, we have wounded...
(beat)
Two disaster pods, Colonel. You can do that.
A long time before Tigh answers.
TIGH
Because you're the Old Man's son and because he's 
gonna be damned happy you're alive... Okay. Two pods.
(to Laura)
But no personnel. You get them yourselves, you 
distribute them yourselves, and you're all off the ship 
before we Jump back.
(to Lee)
You report to the flight deck. You're senior pilot now, 
Captain.
Tigh EXITS.
MULTI-SCREEN:
1 -- INT. GALACTICA - REPAIR BAY 
Kara is underneath her damaged Viper, working with a tool kit to repair one of the fuel lines, while 
other Deck Hands swarm over the fighter, repairing other damaged systems.2 -- INT. RAGNAR STATION - CARGO BAY
Tyrol is supervising Cally, Socinus and the rest of the Deck Hands as they load the last weapon coil 
onto a pallet.
3 -- INT. GALACTICA - PASSAGEWAY
Billy and Baltar are walking through the maze of Galactica's passageways. Billy is leading the way, 
but isn't so sure of his directions. 
4 -- INT. GALACTICA - HANGAR BAY - MUSEUM/MORGUE
Dualla is in the morgue, standing over the dead and badly burned body of Prosna.
1 -- Kara rolls out from beneath the wing, grabs a half-eaten sandwich with grubby hands and tears 
off a bite -- then freezes at the sight of Lee Adama walking into the Bay. He smiles at her.
LEE
Hi.
2 -- Tyrol looks up and sees Sharon Valerii standing in the airlock.
3 -- Billy stops, is suddenly unsure of his sense of direction.
BILLY
Wait... I think we passed it.
4 -- Dualla puts a hand on her dead friend's arm, then ZIPS up the body bag.
1 -- Kara stares at Lee as if she were seeing a ghost. And if we doubted that there's something 
here between these two, it's dispelled when we see the look in Kara's eyes.
2 -- Tyrol doesn't even try to restrain himself, he strides right to her and sweeps her into his arms 
and into a long, passionate embrace.
Cally and Socinus trade a look, then just keep working, studiously avoiding looking at or intruding 
on the private reunion of the two forbidden lovers.
3 -- Billy and Baltar trying to find their way.
4 -- Dualla heads out of the morgue, past body after body...
1 -- Kara stands up as Lee approaches.
KARA
I thought...
LEE
No. Not yet anyway.
She grins and they smack forearms in a jock-bonding gesture. 
2 -- Tyrol and Sharon finally pull back for a beat and then Sharon smiles at him.SHARON
There's someone I want you to meet...
And only then do we reveal Boxey standing behind her, looking up at them.
SHARON (cont'd)
New crewmember. And he's going to need some
quarters.
TYROL
Think we can handle that.
1 -- Lee and Kara are back to business. Professionals.
LEE
How go the repairs?
Kara takes a another bite of her sandwich.
KARA
On track. Another hour and she'll be ready to launch.
(beat)
I guess you're the CAG now.
LEE
That's what they tell me.
KARA
Good. Last thing I want. I'm not a big enough asshole for 
the job.
LEE
I'll be in the squadron ready room.
He heads for the door.
KARA
Hey.
(he stops)
Your father... he probably thinks...
LEE
I'll let him know.
Lee EXITS.
3 & 4 -- Baltar and Billy are still lost, when they nearly run into Dualla coming down the 
Passageway. Dualla and Billy share a look of surprise. Billy recovers first.
BILLY
D. Hi. Uh... kinda lost. Again. We're trying to reach 
CIC. Could you --Dualla suddenly KISSES him. Deeply. Baltar just watches in surprise. Finally Dualla breaks the 
kiss. Steps back. 
DUALLA
This way.
She heads off down the passageway. It takes a beat, but Billy does recover and he and Baltar 
follow her. 
COLLAPSE SCREENS 
TO:
EXT. SPACE - RAGNAR STATION - SPOKE & HUB
Emphasizing the point where one of the long "spokes" connects to the central hub or "axel."
INT. RAGNAR STATION - SPOKE PASSAGEWAY
The tension level between the two men has steadily increased, and Leoben is definitely having 
trouble keeping pace with Adama, who seems curiously detached about the ailing man's condition 
as they make their way through the narrow passageway. Leoben is getting more and more 
agitated.
LEOBEN
Hubris. That's Man's greatest flaw. His belief that he and 
he alone is chosen of God. That only Man has a soul.
ADAMA
(looks ahead)
There's the central hub. We're almost there.
LEOBEN
But what if God decided he'd made a mistake? What if he 
decided that Man was a flawed and imperfect creature? 
What if he decided to give souls to another creature?
(beat)
Like the Cylons.
ADAMA
Somehow, I doubt that. 
LEOBEN
Why? Because they're different than us? Because 
they're the outsiders.
ADAMA
Because God didn't create the Cylons. We did. And I'm 
pretty sure we didn't include a soul in their programming. 
LEOBEN
But what if they do now? What if they've changed in the 
last four decades?Adama stops at the CENTRAL HUB. Because the Spoke and the Hub meet at right angles, the 
floors are PERPENDICULAR to one another and the two men will have to transition from walking 
from what looks like the "floor" to what looks like the "wall." They're both experienced space 
travellers and this is nothing unusual to them, but to us it should be strangely disorienting.
ADAMA
Changed into what?
LEOBEN
People. What if they've developed a culture, a society, an 
entire way of life?
ADAMA
You mean what if they're imitating a culture, a society, a 
way of life. In the end, they're still just devices. Things. 
Pieces of technology that've gotten out of control. They're 
not people.
LEOBEN
You're not even interested knowing the truth are you?
Adama turns on Leoben, faces him squarely as he lets some of his own deep anger bubble to the 
surface for the first time.
ADAMA
Let me tell you something. After today -- after using 
nuclear weapons against defenseless civilians, after 
murdering people by the millions -- I don't give a damn 
who the Cylons are now or what the "truth" is about their 
souls. All I know is that they're murderers and killers and 
they're trying to destroy us.
(beat)
So today's gonna be the first day of a new war. And this 
time we're going to finish the job. No armistice, no peace 
treaty, no mercy. This time we track them down and kill 
them. All of them. Until there's not one single Cylon left 
alive in the universe. And if God has a problem with that, 
he can sort it out on Judgement Day.
A quiet beat as Leoben slowly nods.
LEOBEN
And that's why God wants the Cylons to destroy mankind. 
Because as long as there's a human race, there's going to 
be a man out there like you. I don't think the Cylons hate 
you, Adama... I think they fear you...
Leoben's body is suddenly wracked with spasms and he doubles over in a violent, hacking cough. 
Adama watches him dispassionately, carefully.
ADAMA
If you're going to puke, try to keep it on this side of the 
gravity shift.Leoben tries to control one trembling hand, fails. He's reaching the end and he knows it. His tone 
grows darker.
LEOBEN
What is it about this place?
ADAMA
What do you mean?
LEOBEN
You know what I mean. What's it doing to me?
ADAMA
I thought it was your allergies.
Adama casually stands next to the TRANSITIONAL SPACE between the spoke and the hub. (The 
Transitional Space is defined by a LIGHT BORDER running around the passage intersection. Once 
a person ENTERS this small area, he is WEIGHTLESS and FLOATING until he reorients his body 
to the hub's gravitational direction, then gently puts his feet through the light "border" into the Hub 
side, the Hub's gravity grabs his feet and he is PULLED down to the floor of the Hub.)
Leoben glares at him, his breath growing more ragged.
LEOBEN
I don't have allergies.
So we're putting our cards on the table...
ADAMA
Never thought you did.
LEOBEN
So what is it about this... station, eh? Why is it in the 
middle of the largest planetary storm in the solar system. 
Why'd you put a fleet anchorage here?
ADAMA
You tell me.
LEOBEN
The storm. It's the storm isn't it? It puts out... something. 
Something you "discovered" has an affect on Cylon 
technology?
(beat)
That's it, isn't it? This is a refuge. A last ditch place to 
hide in case of Cylon attack. Right?
(beat)
It won't be enough, Adama. I've been here for hours. 
Once they find you, it won't take them that long to destroy 
you. They'll be in and out before they even get a 
headache.
ADAMAMaybe. But you won't be around to find out. The silica 
chips in your brain -- or whatever you call that thing that 
lets you pretend to think -- they're decomposing even as 
we speak. You'll be dead in a few minutes. How does 
that feel? If you can feel.
Leoben laughs -- the laugh turns into a cough.
LEOBEN
Oh, I can feel, Adama. I feel more than you'll ever 
conceive. But I won't die. When this body fails, my 
consciousness will just be transferred to another one. 
And when that happens, I think I'll tell the rest of my 
people exactly where you are... and then I think they'll 
come here... and I think they'll kill all of you... and I think 
I'll be there watching it happen.
ADAMA
You know what I think? I think if you could transfer out of 
here, you would've done it long before now. I think the 
storm's radiation is blocking your connection. So I don't 
think you're going anywhere. I think you're trapped in that 
body.
(beat)
I think you're doing to die here. And I think I'm going to 
enjoy that.
LEOBEN
It won't matter. Sooner or later... the day comes when 
you can't hide from what you've done anymore.
Adama stares at him -- how the hell did know that phrase? Then suddenly, Leoben LEAPS right at 
Adama, with a BLURRED SPEED that we never suspected he was capable of until now.
-- But Adama is just a split second ahead of him -- he throws himself BACK THROUGH the 
Transitional Space. His body does a 360' through the weightless environment, then he lands on his 
FEET in the Hub.
-- Leoben, instead of crashing into Adama, finds himself hitting empty air and falling into the 
WEIGHTLESS space. His momentum shot, he floats for a moment.
-- Adama whirls around, hits a switch on the Bulkhead. EMERGENCY DOORS slam into place on 
either side of the Transitional Space, threatening to trap Leoben in between.
-- But Leoben is unbelievably FAST. He hurtles out and into the Hub in a BLUR, but crashes into 
the floor head first.
-- Adama pulls a PRYING BAR out of an emergency locker on the bulkhead and SWINGS it at 
Leoben's head -- connecting with a sickening CRUNCH.
-- It's a short, brutal fight, with Leoben's superior strength and agility hamstrung by his weakened 
condition. But even so, Adama barely can hold his own against the Cylon. Adama SMASHES the 
rod into Leoben's head over and over again, with a force and ferocity that would've killed a human being instantly, but Leoben goes down slowly, hanging on until finally he collapses on the floor, 
dead.
Adama sags against the bulkhead, exhausted and bruised. He looks down in surprise -- what looks 
like HUMAN BLOOD is FLOWING from Leoben's skull.
He's shocked. Reaches down, touches the blood -- smells it. Could he have a made a horrible 
mistake? He stares down at the blood pooling around his feet.
INT. GALACTICA - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Gaeta and Baltar are at the Navigational station. Gaeta punches up some information on one of the 
consoles.
GAETA
So lemme get this straight -- the Cylons found a way to 
use your navigation program to disable our ships?
BALTAR
Essentially, yes. I think they're using the CNP to infect 
your ships with some kind of computer virus, which 
makes them suseptible to Cylon commands.
Gaeta points to the complicated text on screen.
GAETA
Well, you can see we do have your CNP navigation 
program here on Galactica, but it's never been loaded into 
primary memory or even test run.
BALTAR
Good. That's... good. You shouldn't have any problems 
then. But I should still erase the program just to be safe 
and then purge any remaining references from the rest of 
your memory tapes.
GAETA
I better have the deck crew retro-fit the newer Vipers as 
well. Here's the checklist for the CIC computer.
Gaeta hands him a 3-ring binder and Baltar sits at the console, starts to punch in numbers. Gaeta 
lingers a moment.
GAETA (cont'd)
This must be hard for you...
BALTAR
What do you mean?
GAETA
Having something you created twisted and used like 
this... must be... horrible... the guilt...
ANGLE - NUMBER SIXIs suddenly standing behind Baltar. She slips her arms around his neck. 
NUMBER SIX
I remember you telling me once that guilt is something 
small people feel when they run out of excuses for their 
behavior.
ANGLE - BALTAR & GAETA
No time has passed. Number Six does not exist in the real world, and whether she's a chip in his 
head or a subconscious hallucination, Baltar's interactions with her are entirely subjective. To 
Gaeta, there's no pause in the conversation.
BALTAR
It is hard. I feel... responsible -- in a way -- for what's 
happened. 
ANGLE - NUMBER SIX
Stroking Baltar's hair.
NUMBER SIX
But you don't. That's part of the reason I fell in love with 
you. You have a clarity of spirit. You're not burdened by 
conscience or guilt or regret...
ANGLE - BALTAR & GAETA
Baltar's anxiety level rises precipitously.
GAETA
I bet. But... try to remember, it's not really your fault. 
You didn't have anything to do with this. It's not like you 
knew what they were going to do...
ANGLE - NUMBER SIX
Her nose nuzzles into his ear.
NUMBER SIX
Not like you knew you were lying... not like you were 
breaking the law... not like you cheat on women... not like 
the world's coming apart and all you can think of is Gaius 
Baltar...
ANGLE - BALTAR & GAETA
Again, no time has actually passed.
BALTAR
(trying to keep it together)
No. No, I know. Exactly what you're sayin. I know. GAETA
Let me know if you need anything.
Gaeta heads back to the Tactical station just as Billy brings Baltar a cup of coffee.
BILLY
Extra sweet...
BALTAR
Thanks.
Billy then takes a cup over to Dualla. Baltar sips the coffee, tries to get control of his racing heart. 
Number Six slides into view next to him as they both watch Billy hand Dualla the cup.
NUMBER SIX
You know, I really do hope you make it out of here alive. I 
think we can have a real future together. 
Baltar tries his best to ignore her, goes back to work at the FTL console. Dualla gives Billy a brief 
smile of thanks, then goes back to her work. Billy hovers for a beat, then finds himself a chair 
somewhere.
BALTAR
Yeah, that'll be... special.
NUMBER SIX
You don't have to be sarcastic. Especially when I'm trying 
to help you.
BALTAR
And how are you doing that...?
She turns his head and forces him to look --
BALTAR'S POV -- ON DUALLA & BILLY
Billy is still sitting near Dualla, who is working her console and talking on her head mic.
NUMBER SIX (O.S.)
See anything there that looks familiar?
RESUME BALTAR
BALTAR
No. Should I?
She waits, he looks closer --
BALTAR'S POV - CLOSER ON THE BACK OF DUALLA'S CONSOLE
On the back of the console, blending in nicely with the rest of Galactica's equipment is a unique 
DEVICE which we HIGHLIGHT with a subjective VFX. [And to be clear, this is something that has 
been in plain sight throughout the entire show. It just blends into the equipment and probably every 
single person aboard has seen it and thought nothing of it.]BALTAR
Frowns, tries to figure it out.
BALTAR
I've seen something like that before...
NUMBER SIX
Yes...
BALTAR
(the penny drops)
In your briefcase. You used to carry it around. You said 
it was an electronic organizer.
NUMBER SIX
That would be a lie.
BALTAR
Then it's a... it's a Cylon device.
NUMBER SIX
That would follow.
BALTAR
Did you...?
NUMBER SIX
No. Not my job.
BALTAR
Then that means...
NUMBER SIX
Say it.
BALTAR
There's another Cylon aboard this ship.
As Baltar looks around in sudden fear...
FADE OUT.
END OF ACT FIVE
ACT SIX
FADE IN:
INT. COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Baltar is quietly freaking out. He keeps looking at the Cylon DEVICE on Dualla's console and 
glancing around the CIC. Gaeta notices the look of worry on his face, calls out from the Tactical 
station --GAETA
You okay over there, Doc?
BALTAR
Oh. Yes. Fine. Thank you.
Baltar turns back to the FTL console. Gaeta concentrates on other work. Number Six slips into 
Baltar's lap. Her intense sexuality is the last thing he needs right now.
BALTAR (cont'd)
You're not helping.
NUMBER SIX
I'm sorry. How can I help?
BALTAR
Tell me what to do here. What is that thing?
NUMBER SIX
Honestly? I don't know. 
BALTAR
Well... it hasn't exploded. 
NUMBER SIX
Yet.
(off his look)
I'm just guessing.
BALTAR
I have to warn them.
NUMBER SIX
How do you propose to do that? "Oh, look -- a Cylon 
device!" "Really? But how do you know what a Cylon 
device looks like, Doctor?" "Oh, I forgot to mention I'm 
familiar with their technology because I've been having sex 
with a Cylon for almost two years now."
BALTAR
I'll come up with something.
NUMBER SIX
I love surprises. Speaking of sex...
She slips a hand into his pants.
BALTAR
(can't control himself)
I... don't... know if this... is such a... good idea...
NUMBER SIX
Why not? No one will know. It'll be our secret...He shifts in his seat with ecstasy.
DORAL (O.S.)
Doctor?
ANGLE - BALTAR & DORAL
Baltar looks up at Doral, shocked back to the moment.
BALTAR
Yes?
DORAL
(hands over papers)
You asked for a report on how many civilian ships had 
your CNP program?
BALTAR
Oh. Right. Thank you.
DORAL
You all right? You look a little flushed.
BALTAR
Fine. Thank you.
Doral nods, goes over to talk with Billy.
ANGLE - NUMBER SIX & BALTAR
As Baltar watches Doral cross the room.
NUMBER SIX
What're you thinking...?
BALTAR
I'm thinking someone else may have to be implicated as a 
Cylon agent.
NUMBER SIX
Him? He doesn't seem the type. And I don't remember 
seeing him at the Cylon parties.
BALTAR
Funny. 
(thinking quickly)
He's an outsider. A civilian. A man who's been aboard 
the ship for weeks and had virtually unlimited access to 
this room.
NUMBER SIX
And you wonder why God has told us to eradicate a 
devious species like yours. Say what you will about the 
Cylons, at least we don't turn on each other.BALTAR
There is one problem.
NUMBER SIX
Morally?
BALTAR
Practically. So far, no one aboard this ship even 
suspects that the Cylons look like us now.
INT. JUNIOR OFFICER QUARTERS
Junior Officer Quarters on Galactica are unbelievably small, with two bunk beds, cramped storage 
lockers, fold-down desks and not much else. Tyrol stands in the doorway with Boxey.
TYROL
You like the top bunk or the bottom?
BOXEY
Top.
TYROL
Okay.
He lifts Boxey up and puts him on the bunk. The boy's head nearly touches the ceiling.
BOXEY
This your room?
TYROL
Me? No. This is officer's country. This is where the 
pilots live. 
BOXEY
So who used to live here?
TYROL
A pilot. They called him Carrot -- had red hair, freckles.
BOXEY
Is he dead too?
TYROL
'fraid so.
BOXEY
A lot of people are dead.
TYROL
That's right, son.
He looks him right in the eye, doesn't try to shy away or pretend with him that everything is fine. 
Tyrol seems comfortable with the kid, slips easily, automatically into a paternal role -- probably a 
result of having to care for deck hands who were little more than kids themselves for so long.TYROL (cont'd)
But I don't think you're gonna die.
BOXEY
No?
TYROL
No. You know why? Because you're aboard Galactica 
now and she's a very lucky lady.
BOXEY
It's not a lady. It's a ship.
TYROL
She absolutely is a lady. She happens to be made of 
steel and wire instead of flesh and bone, but she's still a 
living, breathing woman. 
BOXEY
And she's really lucky?
TYROL
That's right. In the first Cylon War, she single-handedly 
fought off five Cylon baseships and made it back to Kobol 
without a scratch. She always fights a good fight, and 
she always brought her people home.
Boxey thinks about that, nods very seriously, seems to take him at his word.
BOXEY
So... she'll bring us home?
TYROL
It's a promise.
They shake on it, and for the first time we see Boxey smile. 
INT. WARDROOM/PASSAGEWAY
Laura has cracked OPEN the HATCH from the Wardroom and is eyeing the TWO ARMED 
GUARDS standing in the Passageway outside. She gives them a faux smile then shuts the door.
LAURA
Feels like we're under arrest. 
(beat)
What the hell's wrong with these people? 
BILLY
With all due respect... you overplayed your hand, 
Madame President.
She turns on him in surprise.
LAURAExcuse me?
BILLY
When you tried to give Colonel Tigh a direct order. He's 
just second in command on this ship and suddenly you 
forced him to make a choice between you and his 
commanding officer. No way he's gonna pick you.
Laura just looks at him -- he's right. 
LAURA
So how is it you're that smart and this is the first I'm 
hearing of it?
Billy looks at her for a moment -- then she remembers.
LAURA (cont'd)
Wait a minute. You're the...
BILLY
(grins sheepishly)
I thought you read my resume.
LAURA
I did, but there was a stack of them and I let Personnel 
make the selection. So you're the kid who won the Siltzer 
Prize for a paper on...?
BILLY
Diplomacy and public administration. 
LAURA
And you've kept your mouth shut all this time? 
BILLY
You haven't asked my opinion, Madame President.
Touche. 
LAURA
Well, I'm asking now. What do you think we should do 
here?
BILLY
These are military people. Tradition, duty, honor -- they're 
more than just words to them. They're a way of life. If 
you want these people to accept your authority as 
president, you're going to have to make them see the 
situation in those terms.
LAURA
Wave the flag, sing the national anthem? That kind of 
thing?BILLY
That's part of it. The protocols and traditions of service 
mean a lot here. But more importantly, you have to be
the President. Every minute. Stand up to them, but don't 
lose your temper -- not really. If you're going to yell, do it 
for effect, not to vent your own feelings.
(beat)
And most of all, don't ever let them think they're your 
equal. Because the minute they think you're not the 
President... we really are going to be under arrest. 
INT. GALACTICA - WEAPON CONTROL ROOM
Tyrol and Cally working the consoles.
TYROL
(picks up phone)
CIC, Weps. Coil one is on-line and ready for charging.
GAETA (PHONE)
Copy that, Weps. Stand-by.
Tyrol puts the phone back in its cradle and writes on a clipboard. Cally glances over at him. 
CALLY
We, uh... we're all really glad Lieutenant Valerii made it 
back.
TYROL
That's nice.
CALLY
All of us. Really glad.
Tyrol just keeps writing.
TYROL
You have a point to make, Cally?
CALLY
Nothing. Just... that we know. Okay? About you two.
TYROL
Hard not to, seeing as how we pretty much announced it 
to everyone this afternoon.
CALLY
We knew a long time before that.
Tyrol looks up.
CALLY (cont'd)
No secrets on a warship, Chief. You taught us that. TYROL
So you've known. Okay. We finished here?
Cally's temper flares.
CALLY
No, we're not finished! You can bust me down to recruit, 
but you're out of your frakking mind! She's our division 
officer -- she signs off on our fitness reports, our POD 
assignments, our promotions and you're banging her! 
Tyrol is on his feet, so's Cally. The phone BUZZES.
TYROL
(grabs phone)
Weps.
(listens, then hangs up)
Combat wants to begin the start-up sequence.
Tyrol sits back down at his console, flips the clipboard open and starts punching in numbers. Cally 
watches him for a beat, then sits down at her own console.
INT. GALACTICA - PASSAGEWAY/GANGWAY/PASSAGEWAY
The corpse of Leoben is on a stretcher and being carried down the passageway by a pair of Deck 
Hands. Adama, still splattered with blood and bearing his own injuries from the fight, walks with the 
stretcher along with Tigh.
TIGH
This just gets worse and worse. So now the Cylons look 
like us?
ADAMA
Right down to their blood.
TIGH
My God... you realize what this means? They could be 
anywhere. Anyone.
ADAMA
I've had time to think about it, yes. 
TIGH
What do we do?
ADAMA
I have no idea.
(beat)
Where are we on the coils?
TIGH
They're aboard, being fitted in place. Should be 
operational within the hour. Something else -- Lee's alive.Adama's head snaps around at that.
ADAMA
Lee?
INT. SQUADRON READY ROOM
Lee is on a phone handset and updating the status of the Vipers on the large board.
LEE
(to phone)
Okay, I want the new Mark seven Vipers in Repair Bay 
five. We need to strip out the CNP programs from their 
navigation systems.
(beat)
No, no don't do that. We can strip out ox lines from the 
starboard relays...
Adama ENTERS. Lee sees him, is fully prepared for a confrontation. He's expecting a buttchewing session over his disobedience to his father's orders.
LEE (cont'd)
(to phone)
I gotta go.
He hangs up and braces himself.
LEE (cont'd)
Commander.
But when Adama looks into the eyes of the son he thought he'd lost, he walks across the room, 
hugs him tight and begins to cry.
Lee stands there utterly unprepared for this sudden show of naked emotion from his father. He isn't 
sure what to do for the longest time... then finally puts his arms around his father and holds him in 
return.
FADE OUT.
END OF ACT SIX
ACT SEVEN
FADE IN:
INT. ADAMA'S QUARTERS
Adama and Tigh are meeting with Baltar, who is looking over a report. 
TIGH
Our ship's doctor says at first glance, everything in 
Leoben's body looked human right down to the cellular 
level.BALTAR
(off report)
Internal organs -- normal. Bloodwork -- normal. 
Lymphatic system -- normal...
ADAMA
Page five is where it gets interesting. On a hunch, Doc 
took a large tissue sample, cremated it and examined the 
residue.
BALTAR
(off report)
"Sample yielded unique chemical compounds during 
cremation that revealed tissue to be synthetic in nature."
(beat)
So... he was a Cylon.
ADAMA
That's right. And now we have a problem.
TIGH
A big one.
ADAMA
If the Cylons look like us, then any of us can be a Cylon.
BALTAR
That's a, uh... a frightening possibility.
ADAMA
We can't very well go around cremating people, so we 
need a better way to screen human from Cylon. That's 
where you come in.
BALTAR
Me?
TIGH
Rumor has it, you're a genius.
ADAMA
Can you come up with a way to find any Cylons lurking in 
our midst?
BALTAR
I... I will certainly give it my all, Commander.
ADAMA
Our research facilities are a little meager, but what we 
have is at your disposal.
TIGH
But keep this to yourself for now. We don't want to start 
panic or people to begin accusing their neighbors of being Cylons because they don't brush their teeth in the 
morning.
BALTAR
I'll be very discreet.
Baltar EXITS.
INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS
Baltar finds Number Six waiting for him. She falls into step at his side.
NUMBER SIX
I take it you have something in mind.
BALTAR
I'm going to do just what they asked me to do -- build 
them a Cylon-detector.
NUMBER SIX
You know that's impossible, of course.
BALTAR
They don't know that.
NUMBER SIX
One might almost believe you had an angel watching over 
you, Baltar.
INT. ADAMA'S QUARTERS
Tigh and Adama are onto the next problem.
TIGH
What do you want to do about Laura Roslin?
ADAMA
Where is she?
TIGH
Cooling her heels in the Wardroom.
ADAMA
Leave her there for now. Figure out what to do with her 
later.
A quiet beat between the two men. Tigh rubs his eyes, the stress of the situation and the guilt he 
feels over his handling of the fire weighing heavily on him.
ADAMA (cont'd)
You okay?
TIGH
Sure. Yeah. Just thinking about... the fire...ADAMA
You made the call. I don't question it. You shouldn't 
either.
Tigh nods absently. Adama doesn't pursue it. He notices a message slip stuck onto a corner of 
the desk.
ADAMA (cont'd)
(re: slip)
Got a message from Getty yesterday.
TIGH
Yeah? Haven't heard from him since he cashed out two 
years ago. What's he doing?
ADAMA
Sales. Some kind of ad agency.
TIGH
Figures.
ADAMA
(chuckles)
Yeah.
TIGH
Remember Getty and that one-eyed Colonel from Port 
Taurian?
ADAMA
How he got out of that, I'll never know.
TIGH
It's a gift. The man knows how to talk.
(beat)
You ever hear from Bushman?
ADAMA
Not in years. Last I heard, he was fishing up in the 
Coralines. Can't quite picture it, though. He always 
seemed to be in motion even when he was standing still.
TIGH
What about the rest of the old squadron? Kicker, 
Jackman, Billyboy...
ADAMA
Arnold, Slavy, Redbone... I get a letter now and again, but 
not much.
TIGH
How many times did we swear we'd stay in touch that 
night at Morrigan's?ADAMA
Twice with each round of drinks as I recall.
A grin before the somber truth descends once again.
TIGH
Probably all dead now.
ADAMA
Odds are.
Beat.
TIGH
The food at Morrigan's was really something.
ADAMA
Worst in the world.
And they lapse back into a silence that speaks volumes. 
INT. LAUNCH BAY
Kara Thrace is back in the cockpit of her Viper, with the canopy up as she goes through a 
checklist. Lee steps up on the wing and leans in as she puts her helmet on.
LEE
Back in business?
KARA
Looks that way.
LEE
You understand the mission?
KARA
Put my head outside the storm, look around, listen for 
wireless traffic, come home.
LEE
No heroics. This is strictly recon. Look, listen, return.
KARA
Don't worry about me. My taste for heroics vanished about 
the time I engaged that first Cylon fighter.
(beat)
You see your father?
LEE
Yeah.
KARA
You look like you still have most of your ass intact so it 
couldn't have been that bad.LEE
No. It... it wasn't like that. It was, uh... okay. I mean, I 
don't know... it's okay for now. I guess.
She nods and he starts to climb down off the wing. Then Kara has something she finally just has to 
say.
KARA
Lee... 
(he looks up)
Zak failed basic flight.
LEE
What?
KARA
Or at least he should've. But he didn't, because I passed 
him. His technique was sloppy and he had no feel for 
flying, but... I passed him. Because he and I... because I
felt something and I let that get in the way of doing my 
job. I couldn't fail him.
Lee just stares at her in shock. She stares back, finally can't meet his eyes any longer. 
LEE
Why are you telling me this? Why now?
KARA
(trying to be sardonic)
It's the end of the world, Lee. Aren't we supposed to be 
confessing our sins?
She taps her helmet.
KARA (cont'd)
(hoarse)
Set.
Then she pulls down the canopy, and Lee has to back off the Viper as the ENGINE WINDS UP.
INT. GALACTICA - PASSAGEWAY
Doral walks down the Passageway, rounds a corner, prepares to go down a gangway ladder, then 
pulls up short --
TWO ARMED DECK HANDS
Are pointing sidearms at him from the foot of the ladder.
DORAL
Reacts, but before he can say anything --
CAPTAIN KELLY (O.S.)Stand tall there, now...
WIDEN
To reveal Kelly and several more armed Deck Hands pointing sidearms at him.
CAPTAIN KELLY (cont'd)
No sudden moves.
OFF Doral's surprised reaction...
TIGH
(prelap)
If he's really a Cylon, then why isn't the storm radiation 
making him sick by now?
INT. BRIG
Tigh is watching Doral through the bars of Galactica's tiny brig, while Baltar stands nearby with a 
long computer PRINT-OUT in his hand. Doral is tightly manacled in place on the bunk and two of 
the Deck Hands have their weapons pointed right at him through the bars.
BALTAR
I can only theorize that it takes a while for the storm's 
effects on Cylon physiology to become readily apparent. 
By the time you encountered Leoben, he'd been here for 
several hours.
DORAL
I don't suppose it matters to you that I am not a Cylon.
TIGH
Smartest thing you could do right now would to shut your 
mouth.
(to Baltar)
You're sure about your conclusions?
BALTAR
One can never be one hundred percent sure, but the 
evidence seems clear...
Number Six sidles up, peeks in through the bars at the prisoner.
NUMBER SIX
He doesn't look like a Cylon...
BALTAR
(a little hyper)
Basically, all I did was expand on your doctor's analysis 
of Leoben's corpse. I took random hair samples from 
people in and around the CIC, subjected the samples to a 
new form of spectral-analysis I've been experimenting with 
and then wrote a computer subroutine to screen for 
synthetic chemical combinations.(re: Doral)
His sample was the only one to register as synthetic.
Baltar hands over the print-out, which is covered with dense, indecipherable text and row upon row 
of numbers and data. Tigh glances through it for a moment.
TIGH
I'll take your word for it.
NUMBER SIX
And just like that, Doctor Baltar invents the amazing 
Cylon detector. 
DORAL
Gentlemen, I understand your concerns here. This is a 
very difficult situation. But you need to take a step back, 
take a deep breath and really look at what you're doing. 
TIGH
(ignoring him)
I want everyone aboard ship screened. No exceptions.
BALTAR
No problem.
Baltar makes as if to go, then does his best to be casual.
BALTAR (cont'd)
Oh. I don't know how important this is, but... when I was 
in CIC earlier, I noticed Mr. Doral seemed to be doing... 
well, I'm not sure exactly what he was doing, but he 
seemed very interested in this odd device attached to the 
back of the Dradis console.
DORAL
What!?
Tigh pales, strides over to a wall phone and yanks the handset. Number Six slips her arms around 
Baltar.
NUMBER SIX
We should really make a copy of your brain pattern at 
some point.
DORAL
What the hell are you talking about?! What device?!
TIGH
(urgent)
Combat, this is Tigh. Isolate the Dradis console 
immediately. No one comes near it until I get up there.
Tigh hangs up the phone and heads for the door.DORAL
Hey, what about me!
CAPTAIN KELLY
(re: Doral)
What about him?
TIGH
If he moves, kill him. 
INT. COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
A few minutes later, Tigh watches as Dualla carefully removes the Cylon DEVICE from the back of 
the Dradis console and then places it in a CONTAINER. Gaeta is looking over a stack of paperwork 
on a clipboard.
GAETA
I don't see anything in the maintenance records... but I'm 
pretty sure I first noticed it about a week ago.
TIGH
And you didn't say anything? Didn't investigate a new 
piece of equipment just appearing in CIC?
GAETA
No, sir. I... I assumed it was part of the... the museum. 
I'm sorry, sir, I have no excuse for.. 
TIGH
You have plenty of company, Lieutenant. Any one of us 
should've seen the perfectly obvious staring us in the face.
(beat)
Especially the ship's XO.
DUALLA
(closes container)
What should I do with it, sir?
TIGH
Take it to Doctor Baltar. He's becoming our resident 
Cylon expert.
(to Gaeta)
I want every inch of this ship searched for any other 
equipment that "just appeared" in the last week.
GAETA
Yes, sir.
INT. WARDROOM
Adama ENTERS to find Laura standing at the head of the table with Billy, who's going over a long 
list of problems.
BILLY... and medical supplies are running low again, Madame 
President.
LAURA
I get the feeling that's going to be a recurrent problem. 
Next.
BILLY
Three of the ships are reporting engine trouble and want to 
know when they'll be getting engineering assistance from 
Galactica.
LAURA
Good question.
Laura finally decides to notice Adama. 
LAURA (cont'd)
Hello, Commander. Have a seat, I'll be with you in a 
moment.
(to Billy)
Keep going.
Adama is somewhat taken aback, but decides to take a seat and waits. Billy glances between the 
two of them, knows a high-stakes game is being played out here.
BILLY
The captain of the Astral Queen wants you to know he's 
got almost five hundred convicted criminals under heavy 
guard in his cargo hold.
LAURA
Five hundred?
BILLY
Yes, Madame President. They were being transported to 
a penal station when the attack happened.
LAURA
Great.
BILLY
He wants to know what to do with them.
LAURA
What to do with them?
BILLY
Food and medical supplies being what they are, I think 
he's considering...
LAURA
No. We're not going to start doing that. They're still 
human beings. Tell the captain I expect daily reports on his prisoners' well-being and if there are any "mysterious" 
deaths, the Astral Queen may find herself on her own and 
without the Galactica's protection. 
BILLY
Yes, Madame President.
LAURA
Thank you, Billy.
Billy EXITS. Laura looks over the papers on the table for another beat, then sits down, faces 
Adama directly and drops a very calculated bomb in his lap:
LAURA (cont'd)
Are you planning to stage a military coup?
She's caught him completely off-guard.
ADAMA
What?
LAURA
Do you plan to declare martial law and take over the 
government?
ADAMA
Of course not. What the hell are you talking --
LAURA
Then you do accept my authority as President as duly 
constituted under the Articles of Colonization.
Adama tries to dodge facing that one directly.
ADAMA
Miss Roslin, my priority at this moment is the repair of 
Galactica and the resumption of combat operations 
against the enemy.
LAURA
Correct me if I'm wrong, Commander, but as far as we 
know, isn't Galactica the last surviving battlestar? 
ADAMA
(uncomfortable)
We don't know how many battlestars or how many other 
elements of the fleet may have survived.
LAURA
Do you have any reason to think there are other survivors?
ADAMA
We don't know.LAURA
Well, let's focus on what we do know. And what we do 
know is that at this moment there are fifty thousand 
civilian refugees out there who won't have a chance 
without your ship to protect them. 
ADAMA
I understand the tactical situation. But you should be 
safe here at Ragnar after we leave.
LAURA
"After you leave." Where are you going?
ADAMA
We're going after the enemy. We're at war. That's our 
mission.
And now Laura deliberately lets her own temper show, lets her voice rise in indignation:
LAURA
I don't know why I have to keep telling you people this, but 
-- the war is over.
ADAMA
I don't accept that.
LAURA
Commander, your own pilot was there -- ask Sharon 
Valerii what's happening on Kobol. 
ADAMA
(temper flaring)
I know what's happened on Kobol, but my job is to fight 
back.
LAURA
(louder)
With what? One ship?
ADAMA
If that's all we have, then yes, with one ship. 
LAURA
That's insane.
ADAMA
(losing it)
And what do you want me do? Run?
LAURA
Yes! That's absolutely right! The only sane thing to do 
here is exactly that -- run. We leave this solar system 
and never look back.ADAMA
And go where?
LAURA
I don't know. Another star system, another planet --
somewhere the Cylons won't find us.
Adama gets up, heads for the door.
ADAMA
You can run if you want. This ship is going to stand and 
fight.
She keeps raging at his back as he leaves.
LAURA
You don't get it, do you? The human race is about to be 
wiped out. We have fifty thousand people left and that's it. 
If we want to even survive as a species, then we need to 
get the hell out of here and start having babies!
The door closes and he's gone. The second he's gone, she realizes she went too far, and probably 
blew her once chance to get to Adama. Billy ENTERS again after a beat. He looks a question to 
her.
LAURA (cont'd)
I don't know... I just don't know...
EXT. SPACE - KARA'S VIPER
Is carefully winding its way through the STORM CLOUDS up toward open space.
DUALLA (WIRELESS)
(fritzed)
Starbuck/Galactica. You should be approaching turn 
eight.
INT. KARA'S VIPER - CONSOLE POV
Kara struggles with her controls as the winds from the storm BUFFET her fighter. She checks her 
position against a small navigational table attached to her flight suit leg.
KARA
(to mic)
Copy that. Starting to lose wireless contact. Making the 
final turn now...
EXT. KARA'S VIPER - WING CAMERA POV
The fighter BANKS and turns against the dizzying background of the storm.
OVERHEAD COCKPIT POV
Looking ahead, we can see OPEN SPACE looming before us as the Viper completes its turn.KARA (WIRELESS)
Galactica/Starbuck. I've reached the threshold.
INT. KARA'S VIPER - CONSOLE POV
All she hears in reply is STATIC.
KARA
Galactica, do you read me?
More static. She gives up, concentrates on piloting.
EXT. SPACE - KARA'S VIPER - CHASE CAMERA POV
The Viper clears the storm.
MULTI-SCREEN:
1 -- INT. KARA'S VIPER - CONSOLE POV 
As she makes adjustments to her Dradis screen. 
2 -- INT. KARA'S VIPER - ON DRADIS SCREEN
It suddenly FILLS with CONTACT BLIPS. 
1 -- Kara frowns at the display.
KARA
That can't be right...
She looks up and reacts in shock at what she sees and we add:
3 -- EXT. SPACE - KARA'S VIPER - OVERHEAD COCKPIT POV
4 -- INT. KARA'S VIPER - OVER SHOULDER CAM
Both of which show the space just beyond the storm is FILLED WITH DOZENS OF CYLON SHIPS. 
It's an overwhelming display of massive force, made all the more menacing by the utter stillness 
with which they sit there waiting... waiting for their prey to emerge from the storm and be destroyed.
FADE OUT.
END OF ACT SEVEN
ACT EIGHT
FADE IN:
INT. GALACTICA - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Adama, Tigh, Lee, Gaeta, Dualla listening to Kara's wireless report.
KARA (WIRELESS)(fritzed)
I didn't get an accurate count, but my guesstimate is at 
least ten fighter squadrons, a couple of base ships and a 
whole bunch of drones. 
TIGH
(hits mic)
Starbuck, were you followed?
INT. KARA'S VIPER - CONSOLE POV
The Viper is making its way back through the storm toward the station. Kara checks her Dradis, 
glances back over her shoulder to make sure.
KARA
Negative. No sign of pursuit. From the way they were 
deployed, I'd say they're waiting for us to come to them.
INT. COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Adama nods, motions Tigh, Gaeta and Lee to the navigational station.
DUALLA
(to mic)
Thank you, Starbuck. Continue present course. Return 
to visual contact, then stand-by for instructions.
KARA (WIRELESS)
Copy that, Galactica. Starbuck out.
NAVIGATIONAL STATION
Where Adama looks over the chart of the Ragnar storm in detail along with the others -- and we 
note that Lee has now been accepted as one of Adama's senior officers. 
TIGH
How the hell'd they find us?
GAETA
(guilty)
Probably that device Doral planted in here...
LEE
Could've been Doral himself, could've even been Leoben 
for that matter. 
ADAMA
Doesn't really matter now. They've got us.
LEE
So why aren't they coming in after us?
TIGH Why should they? They can just sit out there and wait us 
out. If it takes a week, a month -- what difference does it 
make to them? They're machines. We're the ones who 
need food, medicine, fuel. 
ADAMA
I'm not going to play their game and try to fight our way 
out of here. 
(beat)
Is there any way for us to make a Jump from inside the 
storm?
TIGH
With all this EM interference mucking up the FTL fix?
GAETA
I tend to agree, sir. I don't think we should even attempt 
to Jump until we've cleared the storm threshold. 
TIGH
Stick our nose out just far enough to get a good FTL fix, 
then Jump...
GAETA
Have to be quick about it, though. They'll launch 
everything they have the first glimpse they get.
TIGH
Right.
Beat. 
LEE
What about the civilians? 
Tigh and Gaeta glance at Adama, expecting an explosion, but none is forthcoming. Adama just 
continues to stare at the chart, brooding on the situation. As his officers argue over the 
possibilities, Adama notices Billy ENTER and go over to Dualla's console. And while Adama 
cannot hear the conversation between Billy & Dualla, their body language and demeanor make the 
conversation of two young people starting to fall for each other obvious even from across the room.
TIGH
They're probably safe for the time being.
BILLY
Hi.
LEE (cont'd)
You mean leave them here?
DUALLA
Hi.
GAETAThe Cylons may not even know they're here in the first 
place. They're probably only interested in us.
BILLY
I'm getting ready to go back to the Transport.
LEE (cont'd)
Now that's a helluva an assumption... 
DUALLA
Oh.
TIGH
Well, we can't very well cram fifty thousand men, women, 
and children aboard this ship.
BILLY
And I just wanted to say... you know... I mean, I know this 
is awkward and all, but... what happened in the uh, 
passageway...
LEE
I'm not suggesting that. I'm just saying we can't leave 
them behind. They should Jump with us.
DUALLA
Yeah. I don't know why I did that. Sorry.
GAETA
I don't know how we're going to manage that... 
BILLY
I do. You had a transcendent moment. It happens in 
literature all the time. People are suddenly swept into 
actions they never could've imagined.
LEE
We could pick a jump spot far enough outside the combat 
zone for--
DUALLA
You don't have a lot of experience with women do you?
TIGH
What the hell's outside the combat zone at this point?
BILLY
Not really, no.
Billy grins at her awkwardly and she wryly grins back, and suddenly everything is clear to Adama.
ADAMA
They better start having babies.Tigh, Gaeta, and Lee look at him in surprise, then follow his gaze and note the quiet moment 
between Billy and Dualla happening across the room (and who are unaware of the attention).
TIGH
Is that an order?
ADAMA
It may be before too long.
(beat)
Okay, we're taking the civilians with us. 
(beat)
We're leaving the solar system and we're not coming 
back.
Surprised looks from the three officers.
TIGH
We're running?
Adama looks up sharply at that.
ADAMA
That's right. We're running. 
GAETA
But, sir... the war. We can't just --
ADAMA
War's over. We lost. Time to accept that gentlemen.
Tigh and Gaeta stare at him in shock. Then Lee steps up next to his father.
LEE
My father's right. War's over. Time to get out of here.
A beat between Adama and Lee as Adama realizes that Lee just referred to him as his father. Tigh 
lets out a long breath. 
TIGH
Where we going?
Adama reaches under the table, rummages through the charts, finally pulls out a star chart. He 
looks it over, then points to a location.
ADAMA
The Prolmar Sector.
LEE
That's gotta be... thirty light years.
TIGH
That's way past the Red Line...
ADAMA(to Gaeta)
Can you plot the Jump? 
GAETA
(hesitant)
I've never plotted a Jump that far, sir... 
ADAMA
Few men have. Can you do it?
Gaeta hesitates just a split-second.
GAETA
Yes, sir.
ADAMA
On your way.
Gaeata takes the star chart, heads for the FTL station.
TIGH
The margin of error at that distance...
ADAMA
I know. We might end up somewhere else entirely, in 
which case we'll have a whole new set of problems. But 
at least we won't be here.
Adama returns to the chart of the storm.
ADAMA (cont'd)
It's a bad tactical position.
(drawing on chart)
We'll have to send the fighters out first, then bring 
Galactica here to a blocking position so the civilians can 
cross the threshold behind us and Jump while we hold off 
the Cylons. 
(to Tigh)
Had a chance to test those new weapon coils?
TIGH
Test'em in combat.
ADAMA
(to Lee)
One thing I want you to make absolutely clear to your 
pilots -- when the last civilian ship has Jumped, every 
fighter has to make an immediate combat landing. I can't 
afford to wait around.
LEE
I'll tell them.
ADAMA(with meaning)
It's important to me that all of my pilots make it back. 
Understand?
LEE
(and he does)
Yes, sir.
Adama nods and Lee heads out of the CIC. Tigh leans in close.
TIGH
So can I ask what changed your mind?
ADAMA
You can ask...
So much for that. Tigh gives him a wry look, then moves on.
TIGH
What should we do about our prisoner?
Adama thinks for a beat.
EXT. SPACE - RAGNAR STATION
Galactica still docked at the station.
DORAL
(prelap)
You can't do this!
INT. RAGNAR STATION - STORAGE LOCKER
Doral is under armed guard by two Deck Hands and being hustled into a walk-in locker just off the 
Cargo Bay. Tigh watches him carefully as the Guards take off his manacles.
DORAL
You can't just leave me here to die!
TIGH
You got food, water, all the luxuries of home.
DORAL
I'm not a Cylon.
TIGH
Maybe. But we just can't take that chance.
Tigh signals the Guards and they back out of the locker.
DORAL
What kind of people are you!
They SHUT the door and lock it.We now go into a MULTI-SCREEN sequence which will cover the entire battle and escape 
sequence from the Ragnar storm.
MULTI-SCREEN:
1 -- EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA 
As the ship moves to the threshold of the storm.
2 -- EXT. SPACE - THE CYLON SHIPS 
The Cylons waiting for them.
3 -- EXT. SPACE - VIPER FORMATION
A mixture of old and new Vipers flying out in front of Galactica.
4 -- EXT. SPACE - CIVILIAN SHIPS
Following Galactica.
5 -- INT. TRANSPORT SHIP
Where Billy and Laura watch and wait.
6 -- INT. GALACTICA - COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Where Adama, Tigh, and Gaeta direct the battle.
GAETA
(off Dradis)
Vipers in position.
ADAMA
Execute.
GAETA
(to Dualla)
Signal to Vipers -- Engage the enemy.
DUALLA
(to mic)
Apollo/Galactica. Engage the enemy.
7 -- INT. LEE'S VIPER
Lee in the cockpit.
LEE
Copy that, Galactica. 
(looks around)
You heard the lady. 
8 -- INT. KARA'S VIPERShe hears Lee's wireless call.
LEE (WIRELESS)
Remember what Starbuck taught you. She's the best 
pilot out here. So toss the book and use your instincts. 
(beat)
Let's do it.
3 -- The Vipers roar out of the storm and into open space.
2 -- The Cylons react and unleash their fighters and missiles.
1 -- Galactica moves out of the storm.
2 -- The Cylons direct fighters and missiles toward Galactica.
4 -- The first couple of civilian ships follow Galactica out of the storm and then FOLD IN and 
VANISH as they JUMP.
1 -- Galactica holds position in front of the storm threshold, effectively blocking the Cylons from 
getting at the civilian ships.
2 & 3 -- The Vipers engage the Cylon fighters.
7 & 8 -- Lee and Kara struggling to hold their own against the Cylons.
1 -- For the first time, we see Galactica herself OPEN FIRE on incoming Cylon ships -- it's a 
devastating amount of firepower coming from batteries spotted all over the ship. The sheer amount 
of firepower is awesome -- this is why a battlestar is something to be feared. Galactica's not just an 
aircraft carrier, she's a warrior in her own right.
4 -- Another pair of civilian ships JUMP.
3 -- A Viper explodes.
1 -- Galactica takes a near miss from a NUKE.
6 -- CIC SHAKES and Tigh rushes over to damage control.
2 -- A Cylon fighter explodes.
4 -- More civilians JUMP.
7 -- Lee's Viper is HIT. One wing is BLOWN AWAY.
8 -- Kara swoops in and defends Lee's crippled ship.
Faster and faster we run through the multi-screens, accelerating the pace of the cuts...
2 & 3 -- The Cylons press home the attack on the Vipers, which are getting mauled.
1 -- Galactica continues to protect the civilians, but the tide is starting to turn against her.
6 -- Tigh is on a phone handset, directing damage control.TIGH
DC teams one and three to weps control aux relay, fire in 
compartments 234 and 235...
7 -- Lee struggles to control his ship.
8 -- Kara is like a demon possessed as she fights off every attempt to get at Lee's Viper.
5 -- Laura's Transport JUMPS
2 & 3 -- The Cylons destroy another Viper.
1 -- Galactica destroys THREE incoming Cylon fighters, but a FOURTH gets past her. 
4 -- More civilians JUMP, but the Cylon Galactica missed DESTROYS TWO CIVILIANS.
7 -- Lee manages to get his ship working again, but it skids and turns wildly.
8 -- Kara takes a hit -- but it's not too bad.
3 -- A Viper whips beneath Galactica and DESTROYS the Cylon that was wreaking havoc with the 
civilians.
4 -- The last civilians JUMP.
6 -- Dualla looks up from her Dradis screen.
DUALLA
Last civilian ship is away!
ADAMA
Recall the fighters, stand-by to engage FTL!
Gaeta is working the checklist at the FTL station.
GAETA
Yes, sir.
(calls out)
Nav?
VOICE
Go!
DUALLA
(to mic)
Galactica to all Vipers -- return to base. Repeat -- return 
to base!
7 -- Lee hears Dualla's wireless call.
LEE
This is Apollo to all Vipers. Return to base immediately! 
That means you, Starbuck.8 -- Kara still protects Lee's ship.
KARA
Save your breath. We go back together.
3 -- The remaining Vipers scream in toward Galactica's landing bay.
6 -- Gaeta keeps running the checklist.
DUALLA
Go!
GAETA
Flight ops?
VOICE #2
Go!
2 -- The Cylon fighters break off as they approach the fearsome firepower of Galactica's defense 
batteries. But right behind them are the much larger CYLON BASE SHIPS (which look like two 
giant squat cones attached at the peaks). The base ships close on Galactica with deadly menace.
3 -- The Viper landings aren't pretty -- they skid and bounce onto the flight deck.
6 -- Dualla is keeping track of the landing Vipers.
DUALLA
Viper three aboard... Viper seven aboard...
Gaeta keeps going with his check list.
GAETA
Sublight?
VOICE #3
Go!
GAETA
Helm?
VOICE #4
Go!
GAETA
(to Adama)
The board is green, ship reports ready to Jump, sir.
DUALLA
Two more Vipers still out there, sir. Starbuck and Apollo.
TIGH
(to Adama)
We can't stand toe to toe with those base ships. We 
should go.Adama hesitates, knows Tigh is right.
7 & 8 -- Kara and Lee desperately try to make it back to the ship. Kara flips around, fires backward 
at a chasing Cylon, DESTROYS him.
6 -- Adama makes his decision.
ADAMA
I'm not leaving them behind. Stand-by.
2 -- The Cylon Base Ships OPEN FIRE -- huge EXPLOSIONS all along Galactica's hull.
6 -- CIC turns to chaos. FIRES breaking out all over the ship, including one right here.
7 & 8 -- Lee's fighter is SLOWING down.
LEE
I'm losing power! I'm not gonna make it, Starbuck -- it's 
over! Just leave, damnit!
KARA
Shut up and hold still.
Kara drops down below Lee's fighter, ROLLS her ship so it's upside down and maneuvers her Viper 
so the two ships are belly-to-belly. Her LANDING STUTS pop out
KARA (cont'd)
Engaging mag-lock.
The magnetic locks on the struts suddenly PULL Lee's Viper toward them -- contact. The two 
Vipers are locked together belly-to-belly.
LEE
You are beyond insane.
KARA
Kicking the burners.
Kara's afterburners FIRE and the two Vipers go screaming toward Galactica.
6 -- Dualla sees the tracks on her dradis.
DUALLA
They're coming in!
2 -- Galactica and the Base Ships are FIRING at point blank range -- EXPLOSIONS everywhere.
7 & 8 -- The tandem fighters of Kara and Lee come screaming into the landing bay 
KARA
Hang on!
They skid and screech across the deck, FLIP ONCE and finally stopping on the far side.6 -- People are putting out fires when Dualla sees it on her console.
DUALLA
They're aboard!
ADAMA
JUMP!
1 & 2 -- Just as the Base Stars are unleashing their largest fire yet, Galactica JUMPS and we...
COLLAPSE SCREENS 
TO:
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA
As the ship UNFOLDS in space. The rest of the civilian ships are floating peacefully nearby.
They're safe.
INT. GALACTICA - FLIGHT DECK
Where Kara and Lee's Vipers are still locked together on the deck.
INT. LEE'S VIPER
From his canopy, he can see out through the rear of the bay and into open space. The other civilian 
ships can be seen, and Lee smiles to himself and leans back in his seat in exhaustion...
LEE
Starbuck... I'm definitely putting you up for Captain.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. STARBOARD HANGAR DECK - MUSEUM
Most of the museum trappings are gone, but the stage is still set up. In front of the stage are a long 
row of BODY BAGS, each covered with the Colonial Flag. Elosha (the Priest from Night One) is at 
the podium. The hangar deck is filled to capacity with Galactica crewmen and civilians. A 
CAMERA relays the proceedings throughout the fleet.
In the crowd are Adama Laura, Billy, Lee, Kara, Sharon, Tigh, Tyrol, Gaeta, and Dualla, all with 
heads bowed as Adama finishes the service for the dead. Unlike the audience during the retirement 
ceremony, this crowd is completely focused, rapt with attention on the words of prayer:
ELOSHA
... with heavy hearts we lift up their bodies to you, oh 
Lords of Kobol in the knowledge that you will take from 
them their burdens and give them life eternal. 
(beat)
We also pray that you will look upon us now with mercy 
and love just as you did upon our forefathers many years 
ago. Just as you led the twelve tribes to Kobol, so now 
we hope and pray you will lead us to a new home where 
we may begin life anew. So say we all. ALL
So say we all.
The audience raises their heads, Elosha sits down and Adama goes to the podium and looks down 
at the rows of the dead.
ADAMA
Are they the lucky ones? That's the question you're all 
asking yourselves, isn't it? 
(beat)
We're a long way from home. We've Jumped far beyond 
the Red Line and now we're in uncharted space. Limited 
supplies. Limited fuel. No allies. No hope. Maybe it 
would've been better if we'd all died quickly back there on 
Kobol with the rest of our families than to die slowly out 
here in the emptiness of deep space. 
(beat)
Where will we go? What will we do? 
He looks out at the surprised faces and knows that he's struck a chord, caught them off-guard and 
grabbed their attention by voicing their darkest thoughts.
ADAMA (cont'd)
"Life here began out there." Those are the first words of 
the sacred scrolls -- the first words the Lords of Kobol 
gave us countless centuries ago. They tell us in explicit 
terms that we are not alone in the universe.
(to Elosha)
Elosha, there is a thirteenth colony of man, is there not? 
A murmur ripples through the crowd. He waits, lets it pass.
ELOSHA
Yes, the scrolls tell us a thirteenth tribe left Kobol in the 
Early Days. That they travelled far away and made their 
home on a planet called Earth... which circled a distant 
and unknown star. 
ADAMA
It's not unknown. I know where it is. 
Everyone is shocked, amazed -- hanging on his every word. He nods to a DECKHAND standing off 
to one side, who then turns on an OVERHEAD PROJECTOR, with throws an IMAGE up on the 
bulkhead of a DISTANT STAR and several planets. The image is blurry, indistinct. Adama points to 
one of the planets.
ADAMA (cont'd)
Earth.
Another murmur ripples through the room as people crane for a better look.
ADAMA (cont'd)
This image has been one of our most guarded secrets. 
The location -- or at least the general location -- of this star system was known to only the most senior 
commanders in the Fleet. We dared not reveal its 
location to the public while the Cylon threat was still out 
there. And thank the Lords for that, because now we have 
a refuge to go to, a refuge the Cylons know nothing about.
Genuine excitement starts to spread through the crowd like wildfire.
ADAMA (cont'd)
It won't be easy. It will be a long and probably arduous 
journey to get there. But I promise you one thing -- we 
will make it and Earth will be our new home.
The crowd ERUPTS INTO WILD CHEERING. People are screaming, yelling, crying -- it's an 
emotional release that these people have been seeking for days now. Adama comes off the podium 
and is immediately mobbed by people wanting to touch him, wanting to thank him. Everyone in this 
room has hope again.
Everyone, that is, except Laura Roslin, who watches the people surge around Adama with a 
thoughtful expression.
INT. TIGH'S QUARTERS
Tigh is exhausted. Physically, emotionally. He pulls off his boots, unbuttons his shirt... then 
reaches out for the bottle on the desk. There's a KNOCK on the hatch. He sits back. 
TIGH
Come in.
Kara ENTERS.
TIGH (cont'd)
Starbuck.
KARA
Colonel.
A quiet, awkward beat.
TIGH
Yes...?
KARA
I heard about the fire. What you did. What the Chief 
found out later.
Tigh picks up the bottle, pours himself a drink.
TIGH
Nothing you can say I haven't said to myself... but by all 
means, don't deny yourself the pleasure...
KARA
I think the Chief's full of shit.The drink halfway to his mouth, he stops and looks at her.
TIGH
What...?
KARA
How the hell do Cally and Sociuns know the fire wouldn't 
have reached the hangar deck? They don't know. How 
could anybody? The point is, the safety of the entire ship 
was stake and you couldn't take that chance. End of 
argument.
(beat)
You're still an asshole, Colonel. But you made the right 
call. So don't feel guilty and don't punish yourself for it.
(pointedly looks at the bottle)
Plenty of other things for you to feel guilty about.
And with that, she EXITS. Tigh sits there for a beat, stunned. He looks at the drink in his hand... 
then pours it back into the bottle.
INT. WARDROOM
Adama is having something to eat and going over some reports on the table with a weary 
expression when Laura ENTERS. 
LAURA
Am I disturbing you?
ADAMA
Not at all. Have a seat.
Laura sits down, waits a moment, then gets right to it.
LAURA
First of all, I suppose I should thank you for deciding to --
ADAMA
You were right, I was wrong, let's not talk about it.
LAURA
All right.
(beat)
So what is this Red Line that we've Jumped beyond?
ADAMA
It's a... navigational term. There are computational errors 
in every Jump. The further out you Jump, the greater the 
error. Jump past the Red Line and it may be almost 
impossible to find your way back.
LAURA
So we may never find our way back to Kobol.
ADAMANo. We'll have to find Earth instead.
LAURA
There is no Earth. You made it all up.
Adama sits back in his chair, lets her continue.
LAURA (cont'd)
President Adar and I once talked about the legends about 
Earth. His kids were learning about them in school and 
we were discussing the merits of the various texts.
(beat)
Adar was many things, but he wasn't a very good liar. In 
fact, it was something of a problem in his political career. 
(beat)
He didn't know anything about a "secret" location. I know
that. And if the President didn't know, what are the 
chances that you did?
She holds his eyes and there's a long beat as Adama weighs his options here. 
ADAMA
You're right. There is no Earth. It's just a legend.
LAURA
And that photo?
ADAMA
Something I found in our library.
LAURA
Why?
ADAMA
Because... it's not enough just to live, there has to be 
something to live for. 
(beat)
We have fifty thousand people cooped up in a rag-tag 
fugitive fleet. We'll have supply problems, medical 
problems, social conflict, religious divisions -- every kind 
of human conflict you can imagine is going break out in 
these ships. And people don't have something to believe 
in, they're going tear each other apart. They have to 
believe in something larger than themselves. A larger goal 
for everyone. 
(beat)
Let them believe in Earth.
LAURA
How long can you keep up this kind of charade?
ADAMA
Hopefully long enough to find a planet that will sustain 
human life and let us start our lives over.LAURA
They'll never forgive you.
ADAMA
Maybe. But in the meantime, I've given us all a fighting 
chance to survive. And isn't that what you told me was 
the most important thing? For the human race to survive? 
LAURA
Can we really find another planet to colonize?
ADAMA
It may take a while. The number of planets that can 
sustain human life is very small. And there's always the 
chance they may already have some kind of indigenous 
intelligent life on them -- although if there are aliens out 
there, they've been awfully quiet.
Laura thinks it over for a long beat.
LAURA
Who else knows?
ADAMA
Not a soul.
LAURA
All right. I'll keep your secret. But I want something in 
return.
ADAMA
I'm listening.
LAURA
That "rag-tag fleet" out there is more than just a collection 
of ships... 
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA & RAGTAG FLEET
Our chase camera tracks across the familiar lines of Galactica and then across the motley 
assembly of civilian vessels trailing in her wake.
LAURA (V.O.)
We have ships with schools...
INT. CLASSROOM
A space-going "living science" classroom filled with students, who can't help looking out the 
windows even as the teacher tries to keep order.
LAURA (V.O.)
Hospitals...
INT. HOSPITAL SHIPA hospital ward filled to overflowing.
LAURA (V.O.)
Merchants...
INT. MARKETPLACE
Like the domed Meadow seen earlier on the cruise ship, this is an artificial market place built to 
resemble a "village square." An enormous DOME looms overhead, letting in starlight.
LAURA (V.O.)
Police departments...
INT. POLICE SHIP
A crowded warren of cubicles designed to house civilian police officers.
LAURA (V.O.)
Entertainers...
INT. AMPHITHEATRE
Another artificial space designed to evoke a terrestrial amphitheatre, with a stage and seating for a 
large crowd. Again, the stars loom over the (empty) set.
LAURA (V.O.)
It's a living, breathing city...
EXT. SPACE - GALACTICA & RAGTAG FLEET
The chase plane has reached the end of the fleet and now the invisible camera operator turns his 
hand-held camera back to see the fleet receding in the distance.
LAURA (V.O.)
All that's left of our civilization is inside these fragile 
containers.
INT. WARDROOM
As before. Laura and Adama.
LAURA
If this civilization is going to function it's going to need a 
government. A civilian government run by the President of 
the Colonies. 
Adama knows exactly what she's talking about. Bows to the inevitable.
ADAMA
You're in charge of the fleet. But military decisions stay 
with me.
LAURA
Agreed. MULTI-SCREEN:
1 -- INT. WARDROOM [DOMINANT]
Adama looks at Laura, making his final decision.
2 -- INT. SQUADRON READY ROOM
Sharon and some of the pilots are going over flight assignments and paperwork. Boxy sticks his 
head in the door and Sharon rolls her eyes, then waves him in -- the little boy takes the seat next to 
her.
3 -- INT. COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER
Deck Hands are cleaning the residue from the recent fire. Dualla sees Billy pass by the door -- he 
smiles. She smiles back.
4 -- INT. HANGAR DECK
Tyrol and his crew are working on the Vipers. Cally hands him a tool. He says something to her 
(which we cannot hear). She shakes his hand. Peace at least for now.
5 -- INT. KARA'S QUARTERS
Kara hangs a new picture on the wall. It's the photo of her, Zak and Lee, the crease still visible. 
She regards it as it hangs there.
1 -- Adama makes his choice.
ADAMA
Then I think we have a deal... Madame President.
As they shake hands, linking their fates together from this point forward, we...
COLLAPSE SCREENS 
TO:
INT. PASSAGEWAY
Where Baltar is surprised when he comes around a corner and nearly runs into Number Six.
NUMBER SIX
Your escape is a temporary one at best. We will find you.
BALTAR
You can try. It's a big universe. 
NUMBER SIX
You haven't addressed the real problem, of course.
BALTAR
Yes, yes. There may be Cylon agents living among us at 
this very moment just waiting to strike. NUMBER SIX
Some may not even know they're Cylons at all. Sleeper 
agents programmed to perfectly impersonate human 
beings until activation.
BALTAR
I'm not worried. 
NUMBER SIX
I keep forgetting how truly arrogant you are.
BALTAR
If there are Cylons here we'll find them. 
NUMBER SIX
We? You're not on their side, Gaius. 
BALTAR
I'm not on anybody's side. I'm just looking out for myself.
NUMBER SIX
Exactly. Which means you can't tell them all you know 
about us without giving yourself away. Which a shame. 
You could be a real help to them.
BALTAR
Yeah. That is a shame.
INT. ANOTHER PASSAGEWAY
Where Lee and Adama are walking along.
LEE
...and tomorrow I'll begin a formal combat patrol around 
the fleet.
ADAMA
Good. See you in the morning.
They stop outside Adama's quarters. Adama opens the door.
LEE
About Zak... I don't know. I talked to Kara... but still I 
can't help... I don't... I mean...
It's still tough for him to talk about and it shows. Adama waits, then decides to take him off the 
hook.
ADAMA
What do you say we leave that for another time. I think 
we've pulled off enough miracles today, don't you?
They share a look, and then Lee nods.LEE
'Night, Commander.
ADAMA
'Night, Captain.
INT. ADAMA'S QUARTERS
Adama ENTERS, drags his weary body to his bunk and lies down. He's bonecrushingly tired, but 
there's at least a ray of hope with his son now and that's enough. All he can think about is sleep. 
He puts a hand behind his pillow -- finds something. It's a note. It says: 
"There are only 12 Cylon models."
CUT TO:
EXT. SPACE - RAGNAR STATION
Which is now surrounded by Cylon ships.
INT. RAGNAR STATION - STORAGE LOCKER
The door is YANKED OPEN with a screech of METAL, revealing Doral sitting on a box. He's 
sweating, shaking, pale. Obviously ill. On the verge of complete collapse.
He looks up as TWO CHROME CYLONS toss the remnants of the door away, then step aside as 
THREE PEOPLE ENTER. These three people look EXACTLY like LEOBEN and TWO PEOPLE 
who look like NUMBER SIX walk in the room. The Chrome Cylons wait impassively for instructions.
DORAL
We have to get out of this storm. The radiation... affects 
our silica relays.
The others exchange a look.
LEOBEN #2
Where did they go?
DORAL
I... don't know... they were preparing for a... big Jump... 
And if there's still any doubt as to who and what Doral really is, it's dispelled when ANOTHER 
DORAL walks in the locker.
DORAL #2
We can't let them go.
NUMBER SIX #2
Unfortunately I agree. 
NUMBER SIX #3
If we don't they'll return one day and seek resvenge.
LEOBEN #3It's in their nature.
LEOBEN #3 (cont'd)
It may take several decades to track them down.
But before we can even fully assimilate the revelation that Doral really was a Cylon all along, we're 
hit with another, even bigger bombshell --
A Cylon woman walks in the room. And she looks exactly like Sharon Valerii.
SHARON #2
Don't worry. We'll find them.
FADE OUT.
END OF ACT EIGHT
